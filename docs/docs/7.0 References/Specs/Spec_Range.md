The purpose of the [range] model in GridLAB-D is to facilitate the real representation of the oven and cooktop energy consumptions profile. 

## General Description

Electric [range] has oven and an electronic control for the cooktop. It converts electrical energy into heat to cook and bake. 

### Oven

The food in the oven is heated by an electrical element and is controlled by a thermostat. Oven element capacity (wattage) ranges from about 500[[Units|W] to 2500[W], with 1000[W] being common. It heats to the temperature that the user sets it to. Thermostatic controls have a deadband associated with the setpoint to prevent rapid cycling of power to the elements, which would result if the turn-on temperature equaled the turn-off temperature. The deadband is typically a few degrees above and below the nominal setpoint. 

The oven GridLAB-D model is similar to that of GridLAB-D [waterheater] one-node model. 

### Cooktop

The cooktop has burners on the top and is usually installed into a countertop. These are essentially perfectly resistive loads. Each burner on a cooktop can be controlled by the user-controlled knob settings. 

# 

Modeling Assumptions

  * The temperature inside the oven is considered to be uniform throughout.
  * Three cooktop settings are considered for the cooktop model.
  * The cooktop is a timer-based model. This implies that the operating time of the cooktop depends on time settings rather than on system voltage.

### Total Power Calculation

    $\begin{align}P_l &= C_{heat} \cdot p_l\\\

I_l &= C_{heat} \cdot i_l\\\ Z_l &= C_{heat} \cdot z_l\end{align}$$

  


    $ P_{total} = (P_l + (I_l + Z_lV_l) \cdot V_l) \cdot 1000$

    $ E_{total} = \frac{P_{total}}{1000} \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{3600}$

### Thermostat Setpoint Temperatures

    $\begin{align}T_{on}&=T_{set}-\frac{db}{2}\\\

T_{off}&=T_{set}-\frac{db}{2}\end{align}$$

### New Time Calculation

Estimate mass flow: 

    $ \dot{m}= \text{ovenDemand} \cdot 60 \cdot \frac{\rho}{GALPCF}$

Calculate new time 

    $\begin{align}\Delta t &= \frac{\text{log}(c_1+c_2T_1)-\text{log}(c_1+c_2T_0)}{c_2}\\\

c_{11}&=\frac{\text{ovenUA} + \dot{m}_{C_p}}{C_w}\\\ c_{22}&=\frac{(P_{total}\cdot BTUPHPKW) + (\dot{m}\cdot c_{food})+(\text{ovenUA} \cdot T_{amb})}{\text{ovenUA}+(\dot{m} \cdot c_{food})}\\\ T_{new}&=c_{22}-(c_{22}-T_0) \cdot exp(-c_{11} \cdot \Delta t)\end{align}$$

where 

    $\begin{align}c_1 &= \frac{(P_{total} \cdot BTUPHPKW + ovenUA \cdot T_{amb} + \dot{m} \cdot C_p \cdot T_{inlet})}{C_w}\\\

c_2&=\frac{-(ovenUA+\dot{m}\cdot c_{food})}{C_w}\\\ C_w &= \frac{v_{oven}}{GALPCF} \cdot \rho \cdot c_{food}\end{align}$$

To facilitate data operations between the individual [objects] and the dynamic solver capability, a common data structure will be used to pass information back and forth. This data structure should contain information and pointers to the following elements. 

Table 5: Range interface elements  Variable | Definition   
---|---  
[timestamp] | Pointer to current [timestamp] of the solution   
timestamp_change | Pointer to the difference between the last and current [timestamp]  
energy | Pointer to accumulated energy consumption of the system   
voltage | Pointer to complex voltage values of the object  
current | Pointer to complex current values of the object  
power | Pointer to complex power contributions of the object  
impedance | Pointer to complex impedance contributions of the object  
  
  


## Solver Timing

The [range] model will need to be properly timed with the [powerflow] solution, as well as the requirements of the individual [range] components. 

### Solver Passes

The oven model follows these steps: 

  1. Solve the time required to change the oven's temperature if the oven's inside temperature is lower than the lower setpoint temperature.
  2. Solve the oven interface components based on its settings.
  3. Update the energy calculation.
After these steps are complete, the simulation advances to the next [timestamp]. This sequence will repeat until the next GridLAB-D overall [timestamp] is encountered. At that point, the changes will be reflected into the quasi-steady state [powerflow] solution, and the process will repeat until the given energy consumption is elapsed. 

The cooktop model follows these steps: 

  1. Solve the cooktop interface conponents based on its settings.
  2. Update energy calculation.
