## Overview

As part of the DistribuDyn project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO), advanced inverter-based-resource models were created to represent devices being deployed on the modern power system. The model in [inverter_dyn] represents a generalized inverter. This page represents graybox models generalized from hardware tests and measurements of commercial hardware. The ``ibr_graybox`` model is produced by Purdue University as part of the DistribuDyn. project. 

## Background

In real-world scenarios, the full-spectrum dynamics of distribution systems with inverter-based resources (IBRs) are often too complex or inaccessible to model accurately using traditional white-box approaches. At the same time, the intricate input-output relationships can render black-box models either computationally intensive or insufficiently accurate. These challenges motivate the development of hybrid modeling strategies that combine physics-based and data-driven techniques. Inspired by physics-informed machine learning, we propose a gray-box modeling framework for distribution systems with IBRs to enhance estimation accuracy. This gray-box modeling framework leverages the strengths of both white-box and black-box approaches: physics-based white-box models provide structural insight and guide the learning process, while black-box models compensate for unmodeled dynamics, resulting in improved overall performance. 

## Gray-Box Modeling

### Introduction

Figure 1 shows the structure of the IBR gray-box model. It is used to represent the behind-the-meter (BTM) dynamics, and it consists of two sections: an optimization-based model and a data-driven section. The optimization-based model section is used to estimate the parameters for a given control IBR control structure and generate the estimated output of a selected IBR. The estimated output current from the first section and the voltage at the point of the interconnection (POI) serve as an augmented input for the data-driven section, which includes an offline-trained neural network. Finally, the gray-box model of the IBR is represented as a Norton equivalent circuit, with the current output from the data-driven section fed back into the external power network.

### Gray-Box Modeling Algorithm

The framework of the gray-box modeling algorithm is implemented as 

  * Collect the input and output data for the distribution system with IBRs and divide them into a training dataset and a validation dataset
  * Complement prior knowledge with equivalence network model
  * Determine mathematical equations with unknown parameters for the white-box model
  * Estimate parameters in the optimization-based model using the training dataset
  * Embed the output of the optimization-based model as an additional input of the data-driven model (represented using a neural network) and train the neural network with the training dataset
  * Test performance of the gray-box model using the validation dataset
### GridLAB-D Model Example

    };
    

## Optimization-Based Model Section

### Droop Control

The droop control is implemented for the optimization-based model section. The droop gains are selected as the unknown parameters. Furthermore, the values of the droop gains are estimated by using an optimization algorithm to minimize the error between the training data and the estimated data. The corresponding values will be updated in the GridLAB-D model file.

## Data-Driven Section

### Normalization and Reverse Normalization for the Neural Network

The input data should be normalized before being sent to the neural network’s input layer. The following formula is used for normalization: 

$$\displaystyle{}y=2\dfrac{x-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}-1$$

where x represents the input before normalization, and y represents the normalized input used in the neural network’s input layer. 

Similarly, a reverse normalization is required before the neural network process is complete. The conversion is shown below: 

$$\displaystyle{}x^{'}=\dfrac{y^{'}+1}{2}(x_{max}^{'}-x_{min}^{'})+x_{min}^{'}$$

where x’ is the value after the reverse normalization, and y’ is the normalized output from the neural network’s output layer. 

### Neural Network

The neural network is trained offline, after which the weight and bias matrices are extracted and incorporated into the gray-box model. Furthermore, the neural network process is converted into C++ code. An example of a neural network with two neurons and one hidden layer is shown below:
    
    
    double w1[2][4] = {{0.000133,-0.000040,0.080195,0.059271},{-0.000643,-0.000111,-0.101510,0.002551}};
    double w2[2][2] = {{0.366041,-9.635184},{16.403933,13.011528}};
    double b1[2][1] = {{0.025082},{-0.000051}};
    double b2[2][1] = {{-0.007582},{-0.411838}};
    // From input layer to hidden layer 1
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    	for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    		for (k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
    			z11[i][j] += w1[i][k] * u[k][j];
    		}
    	}
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    	for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    		z1[i][j]=z11[i][j]+b1[i][0];
    	}
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    	for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    		z1[i][j]= tanh(z1[i][j]);
    	}
    }
    // From hidden layer 1 to output layer
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    	for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    		for (k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
    			z21[i][j] += w2[i][k] * z1[k][j];
    		}
    	}
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    	for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    		z2[i][j]=z21[i][j]+b2[i][0];
    	}
    }
