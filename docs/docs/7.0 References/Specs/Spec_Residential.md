## Residential Overview

A general purpose enduse object is provided that incorporate a simple translation of a schedule to a loadshape to an enduse load. The enduse is linked to a circuit (which may be either line-to-line or line-to-neutral). 

The residential_enduse class is defined as 
    
    
    class residential_enduse {
           loadshape shape;
           complex demand[kVA]; // the peak power consumption since the last meter reading
           complex energy[kVAh]; // the total energy consumed since the last meter reading
           complex total_power[kVA]; // the total power consumption of the load
           double heatgain[Btu/h]; // the heat transferred from the enduse to the parent
           double heatgain_fraction; // the fraction of the heat that goes to the parent
           double current_fraction; // the fraction of total power that is constant current
           double impedance_fraction; // the fraction of total power that is constant impedance
           double power_fraction; // the fraction of the total power that is constant power
           double power_factor; // the power factor of the load
           complex constant_power[kVA]; // the constant power portion of the total load
           complex constant_current[kVA]; // the constant current portion of the total load
           complex constant_admittance[kVA]; // the constant admittance portion of the total load
           double voltage_factor[pu]; // the voltage change factor
           set {IS220=1} configuration; // the load configuration options
           enumeration {OFF=-1, NORMAL=0, ON=1} override;
           enumeration {ON=1, OFF=0, UNKNOWN=-1} power_state;
           complex total[kVA]; // (DEPRECATED) the constant power portion of the total load
           complex power[kVA]; // (DEPRECATED) the constant power portion of the total load
           complex current[kVA]; // (DEPRECATED) the constant current portion of the total load
           complex admittance[kVA]; // (DEPRECATED) the constant admittance portion of the total load
    }
    

The various end use appliances within the residential module have a common `enduse` member. The four component values of this structure are published consistently by the house as the enduse load name (e.g., _lights_ , _plugs_) The individual properties should be used for internal reference for a given appliance and aggregated to the "enduse_load" property, which may be used for load calculations by the house or by other objects. 

The central importance of the enduse structure is that these four principle properties (power, demand, energy, and heatgain) must be updated by the object using a call to _gl_sync_enduse_ so that when the enduse is attached to a house circuit panel the load accumulate correctly. If the properties are not published and updated, the house will halt the simulator. 

The override property is implemented on a case-by-case between objects, and is meant to provide a mechanism for other objects to force a residential enduse to immediately activate or deactivate. The house, for example, will ignore its previous state and either immediately start heating or cooling, or immediately stop heating or cooling, based on if the house could be in such a state. For example, too-cold houses will not stop heating or start cooling, no matter the signal. 

The power_state property is meant to indicate to other devices whether the enduse is currently drawing power or not. This is primarily used by the market module. 

## Implicit enduses

A number of enduses can be implicitly defined by listing them in the residential module's global parameter _implicit_enduses_. If the parameter is not specified in the module directive, all implicit enduses are activated as shown in Table 1. Implicit enduses that may be specified are: 
    
    
     module residential {
       implicit_enduses LIGHTS|CLOTHESWASHER|WATERHEATER|REFRIGERATOR|DRYER|FREEZER|DISHWASHER;
     }
    

but others are expected any time, so please consult the _\--modhelp residential_ output for what is currently supported.

## Using the House

The house object is a dual purpose class. It first operates to aggregate and contain the effects of the various appliance loads, but also contains an appliance, the HVAC system, which it uses to control the thermal effects of the solar input and the electrical load heat of the building. 

### Default House

PLEASE NOTE: This section on the default house parameters will be deprecated or updated in the near future. Please go to <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gridlab-d/index.php?title=Residential_module_user%27s_guide> for a further, more complete description of the house model. All other information on this page should be up-to-date.

## Using the Freezer

The freezer is modeled by determining the thermal capacity of the hypothetical contents of the freezer and estimating the thermal gains of the freezer cavity through its insulation. Heat gain through intermittent door opening is not factored in at this point. 

From a simulation view, the freezer gradually absorbs heat from the house, and will activate its cooling system motor when the temperature exceeds a certain point. 

### Default Freezer

See [ Freezer Properties]

### Refrigerator State of Development

Refrigerator is considered an experimental model, and may not function correctly at this time. 

## Using the thermal_storage model

The thermal storage model is based on the specifications of Ice Energy's Ice Bear system. It is a 5 ton equivalent unit that is to be used in conjunction with a normal HVAC unit. The Ice Bear unit is used for peak load shifting and does so by storing thermal energy in the form of ice. The ice is made at night and then used during the day to reduce or eliminate the use of the HVAC compressor, thereby reducing the HVAC load to about 10% of normal during peak hours. 

### Default thermal_storage

An empty thermal storage object, along the lines of 
    
    
    object thermal_storage {}
    

will be constructed into a semi-consistent state. Assuming a 5 ton (60,000 Btu/hr) unit the "default thermal storage" ends up being similar to 
    
    
    schedule recharge_sched {
       * 0-10 * * * 1.0;
       * 11-20 * * * 0.0;
       * 21-23 * * * 1.0;
    }
    
    schedule discharge_sched {
       * 0-10 * * * 0.0;
       * 11-20 * * * 1.0;
       * 21-23 * * * 0.0;
    }
    
    object thermal_storage {
       total_capacity 360000;
       stored_capacity 360000;
       recharge_power 3.360;
       discharge_power 0.300;
       recharge_pf 0.97;
       discharge_pf 1;
       recharge_time recharge_sched*1;
       discharge_time discharge_sched*1;
       discharge_rate 60000;
       k 0;
    }
    

Note that setting both "stored_capacity" and "SOC" will raise a warning, since both values are attempted to define the initial capacity of the thermal_storage object. If SOC is used, the stored_capacity will be set to (SOC / 100 * total_capacity). 

Any properties that are not set explicitly will carry these default values, with the exception of the total_capacity, discharge_power, recharge_power and discharge_rate, which will have values based on the designed_cooling_capacity of house_e and scaled appropriately based on the values listed here. 

### thermal_storage Properties

Table 1 - Thermal Storage Properties  Property Name | Type | Unit | Description

total_capacity | double | Btu | The total capacity of energy storage of the unit. When left to default, it is scaled based on the HVAC sizing in house_e.   
stored_capacity | double | Btu | The amount of energy stored in the unit at the start of the simulation. If this exceeds the total_capacity, it will be set equal to the total_capacity. If SOC (state of charge) is also set, SOC is the dominant value and will be used instead.

recharge_time | double | NA | The time schedule indicating the hours of operation for the recharge cycle (0 = OFF, 1 = ON). The recharge and discharge cycles can not overlap. The model will default to a recharge cycle in the event that both are set to be on.   
discharge_time | double | NA | The time schedule indicating the hours of operation for the discharge cycle (0 = OFF, 1 = ON). The recharge and discharge cycles can not overlap. The model will default to a recharge cycle in the event that both are set to be on.   
discharge_rate | double | Btu/hr | The rated capacity of the unit as it would relate to a normal HVAC unit (i.e. a 5 ton unit to cool a house). When left to default, it is scaled based on the HVAC sizing in house_e.

### Default Waterheater

An empty waterheater object, along the lines of 
    
    
    object waterheater { }
    

will be constructed into a semi-consistant state. The "default waterheater" ends up being similar to 
    
    
    object waterheater {
       tank_volume 50.0 gal;
       tank_diameter 1.5 ft;
       inlet_water_temperature 60.0 degF;
       location GARAGE;
       heat_mode ELECTRIC;
       tank_setpoint random.normal(130,10); // bound [100, 160]
       thermostat_deadband (1 + random.normal(2,1)); // bound [1, 10]
       tank_UA random.normal(2.0, 0.2); // bound (1, inf)
       heating_element_capacity 4500 W;
    }
