           double [p_go_home][[unit/h]];
           double [p_go_work][[unit/h]];
           double [work_dist][mile];
           double [capacity][kWh];
           double [charge][unit];
           bool [charge_at_work];

[charge_at_work] | bool | none | Specify if work charging is available.

## Default Evcharger

The minimum definition for an evcharger object is 
    
    
    object evcharger {
    }
    

## Evcharger Schedule

The evcharger object can be put on a schedule to control when it is at home, work, or on a trip. This can be done by using a schedule for the [p_go_home] and [p_go_work] properties (only control when it is at home or work) or by using the [demand_profile] property. 

## Example
    
    
    module residential;
    module tape;
    
    clock {
    	timezone PST+8PDT;
    	timestamp '2001-07-10 00:00:00';
    	stoptime  '2001-07-18 00:00:00'; 
    };
    
    object house {
    	object evcharger {
    		object recorder {
    			file charge.csv;
    			property charge;
    			interval 600;
    		};
    	};				
    }
