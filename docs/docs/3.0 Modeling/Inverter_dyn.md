# Inverter dyn

## Overview

The inverter_dyn is a reworked inverter object. The inverter_dyn object was created to focus on dynamic responses of the inverter, especially in a microgrid or islanded system scenario. The existing inverter object has significant extra modes and some incompatible code. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with that functionality, the inverter was left, as-is, and the inverter_dyn was created to handle the new dynamics-oriented development.
