## Powerflow Overview

The `powerflow` module performs distribution level solver methods to primarily obtain the voltage and current values in a system. Details on the different solver methods and how each object are handled are in the [Powerflow] guide. 

## Inherited Classes

Nearly all objects within the `powerflow` module are derived from two primary objects: `node` and `>link`. Therefore, any properties defined for these two objects are also available to any derived object. For example, a `node` has voltage properties, so a `load` automatically has these properties available as well. Any `powerflow` objects that inherit properties from `node` or `link` will be labeled as such. Furthermore, `node` and `link` contain most relevant default quantities. Derived objects often assume zero value or throw an error if an explicit property is not indicated. Any exceptions to this rule will be indicated in the parameter list of the particular object. 

## Powerflow Objects

Along with all of the properties inherited from either `node` or `link`, all objects within the `powerflow` module inherit two basic properties. These two properties are the phases of the object and the nominal voltage for that area of the system. These are expressed in the `phases` and `nominal_voltage` parameters of `powerflow` objects. 

The `phases` property has a variety of valid inputs. These are: 

  * `A` \- Phase A of a three phase connection
  * `B` \- Phase B of a three phase connection
  * `C` \- Phase C of a three phase connection
  * `D` \- Delta connected phases - this implies ABC, but explicitly specifying them is recommended
  * `N` \- Neutral phase
  * `G` \- Ground phase
  * `S` \- Split phase - this represents residential level wires (2 "hot" and 1 neutral wire)
These different phases can be specified in a variety of ways. Below are some identical examples with a simple `node` object (which is covered in more later in this page). 
    
    
    object node {
    	phases ABC;
    	}
    
    
    
    object node {
    	phases "ABC";
    	}
    
    
    
    object node {
    	phases A|B|C;
    	}
    
    
    
    object node {
    	phases "A|B|C";
    	}
    

The other common property is nominal voltage, which is passed into the objects using the `nominal_voltage` parameter. This parameter is used to ensure connected objects are in the proper region (have the same nominal voltage) and also to specify an initial value for the convergence criteria of the different solver methods. Using the same node example, a 7200 Volt nominal voltage would be expressed as: 
    
    
    object node {
    	nominal_voltage 7200.0;
    	}
    

## Node

The node object is equivalent to a bus of the distribution system. It provides a connection point for `link`-based objects and a point of known voltages on the system. Three phase voltage is typically available in either wye-connected or delta-connected three phase. Wye-connected voltages are contained in `voltage_A`, `voltage_B`, and `voltage_C`. Delta-connected voltages are available in `voltage_AB`, `voltage_BC`, and `voltage_CA`. 

### Default Node

A minimalist node could be created with 
    
    
    object node {
    	name NodeOne;
    	phases ABC;
    	nominal_voltage 7200.0;
    	}
    

which is the same as specifying 
    
    
    object node {
    	name NodeOne;
    	phases ABC;
    	nominal_voltage 7200.0;
    	voltage_A 7200.0+0d;
    	voltage_B 7200.0-120.0d;
    	voltage_C 7200.0+120.0d;
    	bustype PQ;
    	}
    

### Node Parameters

As with all powerflow objects, `phases` and `nominal_voltage` are inherently part of `node`. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
voltage_A  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `A` of a three-phase system. This may be specified in rectangular (7200.0+0.0j) or polar (7200.0+0.0d) formats.   
voltage_B  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `B` of a three-phase system. This may be specified in rectangular (7200.0+0.0j) or polar (7200.0+0.0d) formats.   
voltage_C  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `C` of a three-phase system. This may be specified in rectangular (7200.0+0.0j) or polar (7200.0+0.0d) formats.   
voltage_AB  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `AB` of a delta-connected three-phase system. This is a derived quantity and can be read, but it is not recommended you set this value.   
voltage_BC  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `BC` of a delta-connected three-phase system. This is a derived quantity and can be read, but it is not recommended you set this value.   
voltage_CA  | complex  | Volts  | The voltage on phase `CA` of a delta-connected three-phase system. This is a derived quantity and can be read, but it is not recommended you set this value.   
current_A  | complex  | Amperes  | The current load on phase `A` (wye) or phase `AB` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
current_B  | complex  | Amperes  | The current load on phase `B` (wye) or phase `BC` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
current_C  | complex  | Amperes  | The current load on phase `C` (wye) or phase `CA` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
power_A  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The power load on phase `A` (wye) or phase `AB` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
power_B  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The power load on phase `B` (wye) or phase `BC` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
power_C  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The power load on phase `C` (wye) or phase `CA` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
shunt_A  | complex  | Siemens (mhos)  | The shunt admittance load on phase `A` (wye) or phase `AB` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
shunt_B  | complex  | Siemens (mhos)  | The shunt admittance load on phase `B` (wye) or phase `BC` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
shunt_C  | complex  | Siemens (mhos)  | The shunt admittance load on phase `C` (wye) or phase `CA` (delta) of the node. This value is typically handled through the `load` object, so modification is not recommended here.   
bustype  | enumeration  | N/A  | The type of bus the node represents. The different bus distinctions are only valid for the Gauss-Seidel and Newton-Raphson solver methods. The Forward-Back Sweep method (Kersting's method) does not presently incorporate anything other than the `PQ` bus. Valid choices are 

  * `PQ` for a constant power bus (default)
  * `PV` for a voltage-controlled (magnitude) bus
  * `SWING` for the infinite bus of a system.

  
maximum_voltage_error  | double  | Volts  | The maximum voltage error for convergence checks in the different powerflow solvers. If left blank, it is derived from the `nominal_voltage` parameter.   
busflags  | enumeration  | N/A  | A flag to indicate if the current bus has a source or not. Mainly used for `PV` implementations. The only valid entries are `HASSOURCE` to indicate it is a supported bus, or an empty value indicating it is not. Unused at this time.   
reference_bus  | object  | N/A  | A reference node elsewhere in the system that the `node` will use to obtain frequency information if necessary (unimplemented in GridLAB-D at this point).   
mean_repair_time  | double  | seconds  | Time after a fault clears for the object to be considered back in service. Mainly used for `reliability` module interactions at this time.   
  
### Node State of Development

Node is considered a highly developed and validated model. 

## Link

The link object is a connection between nodes in a distribution system. The `link` object is not directly useful, but is the basis for objects associated with overhead lines, underground lines, triplex lines, transformers, regulators, switches, and fuses. 

### Default Link

A `link` only requires three parameters to be specified by default. Most of the actual functionality comes through other objects. 
    
    
    object link {
    	name Node1toNode2;
    	phases ABC;
    	from Node1;
    	to Node2;
    	}
    

### Link Parameters

Again, as with all powerflow objects, `phases` and `nominal_voltage` are inherently part of `link`. `nominal_voltage` does not need to be specified for `link` objects. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
from  | object  | N/A  | One connecting end of the `link` object. This will be the name or reference to a `node`-based object elsewhere in the powerflow model.   
to  | object  | N/A  | The other connecting end of the `link` object. This will be the name or reference to a `node`-based object elsewhere in the powerflow model.   
power_in  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power flowing into the particular `link` object as a sum of all three phases.   
power_out  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power flowing out of the particular `link` object as a sum of all three phases.   
power_losses  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power loss for all three phases between the input and output of the `link`..   
power_in_A  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase A flowing into the `link`.   
power_in_B  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase B flowing into the `link`.   
power_in_C  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase C flowing into the `link`.   
power_out_A  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase A flowing out of the `link`.   
power_out_B  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase B flowing out of the `link`.   
power_out_C  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power on phase C flowing out of the `link`.   
power_losses_A  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power loss between the input and output of the `link` on phase A.   
power_losses_B  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power loss between the input and output of the `link` on phase B.   
power_losses_C  | complex  | Volt-Amperes  | The calculated power loss between the input and output of the `link` on phase C.   
status  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the line in terms of being `OPEN` or `CLOSED`. This property is mainly used for switches and fuses, but may be used to remove lines from service. This functionality is primarily used in the `FBS` solver mode.   
current_out_A  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing out of the link object on phase `A`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
current_out_B  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing out of the link object on phase `B`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
current_out_C  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing out of the link object on phase `C`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
current_in_A  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing into the link object on phase `A`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
current_in_B  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing into the link object on phase `B`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
current_in_C  | complex  | Amperes  | The calculated current flowing into the link object on phase `C`. Note: This has not been fully tested for every object.   
flow_direction  | set  | N/A  | This is a flag telling which direction current is flowing, relative to the `to` and `from` designations, on a each phase of a link object. 

    0x000 - `UNKNOWN` \- The flow direction is indeterminate.
    0x001 - `AF` \- Current is flowing from the `from` node to the `to` node on phase `A`.
    0x002 - `AR` \- Current is flowing from the `to` node to the `from` node on phase `A` (reverse flow).

    0x020 - `BR` \- Current is flowing from the `to` node to the `from` node on phase `B` (reverse flow).
    0x030 - `BN` \- No current is flowing on phase `B`.
    0x100 - `CF` \- Current is flowing from the `from` node to the `to` node on phase `C`.
    0x200 - `CR` \- Current is flowing from the `to` node to the `from` node on phase `C` (reverse flow).
    0x300 - `CN` \- No current is flowing on phase `C`.  
mean_repair_time  | double  | seconds  | Time after a fault has cleared before the object will be restored to service. Utilized by the `reliability` module.   
  
### Link State of Development

Link is considered a highly developed and validated model. 

## Line

The line object represents power lines in a distribution system. The line object has two implementations: `overhead_line`, and `underground_line`. Each line must be called appropriately. Information about the particular line type will be contained in other objects called `line_configuration`. 

`Line`-based objects inherit properties from the `link` object just covered. Two new properties are also added: `configuration` and `length`. 

Typical usage of an overhead line would be 
    
    
    object overhead_line {
    	name Node1toNode2;
    	phases ABC;
    	from Node1;
    	to Node2;
    	length 5280;
    	configuration Best_overhead_line_cfg;
    	}
    

and the typical usage of the underground line would be 
    
    
    object underground_line {
    	name Node1toNode2;
    	phases ABC;
    	from Node1;
    	to Node2;
    	length 5280;
    	configuration An_underground_line_cfg;
    	}
    

### Line Parameters

Along with the inherited `link` properties, `line` objects have: 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
length  | double  | feet  | Length of the `line` object.   
configuration  | object  | N/A  | Name or reference to the particular configuration object that describes the properties of the `line` object.   
  
## Line configuration

Both `underground_line` and `overhead_line` objects take line configuration information to describe the particular line being implemented, or they can be described in their raw z-matrix values. A typical `line_configuration` object would be implemented as 
    
    
    object line_configuration {
    	name line_config_A;
    	conductor_A overhead_line_conductor_100;
    	conductor_B overhead_line_conductor_100;
    	conductor_C overhead_line_conductor_100;
    	conductor_N overhead_line_conductor_101;
    	spacing line_spacing_200;
    	}
    

or 
    
    
    object line_configuration {
           name line_config_B;
           z11 0.45+1.07j;
           z12 0.15+0.50j;
           z13 0.15+0.38j;
           z21 0.15+0.50j;
           z22 0.46+1.04j;
           z23 0.15+0.42j;
           z31 0.15+0.38j;
           z32 0.15+0.42j;
           z33 0.46+1.06j;
           }
    

If you want to factor in line capacitance effects, the `line_configuration` can be extended to: 
    
    
    object line_configuration {
           name line_config_B;
           z11 0.45+1.07j;
           z12 0.15+0.50j;
           z13 0.15+0.38j;
           z21 0.15+0.50j;
           z22 0.46+1.04j;
           z23 0.15+0.42j;
           z31 0.15+0.38j;
           z32 0.15+0.42j;
           z33 0.46+1.06j;
           c11 198.52;
           c22 198.52;
           c33 198.52;
           }
    

Note that for capacitance calculations to be included in the powerflow, the module-level directive must be included: 
    
    
    module powerflow {
       line_capacitance true;
    

} 

It is highly recommended to use the `line_spacing` and `overhead_line_conductor` or `underground_line_conductor` objects and let the internal equations calculate the capacitance (and impedance) for the user. 

### Line configuration properties

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
conductor_A  | object  | N/A  | Object describing the conductor of phase A in the overhead or underground line object. (`overhead_line_conductor` or `underground_line_conductor`)   
conductor_B  | object  | N/A  | Object describing the conductor of phase B in the overhead or underground line object. (`overhead_line_conductor` or `underground_line_conductor`)   
conductor_C  | object  | N/A  | Object describing the conductor of phase C in the overhead or underground line object. (`overhead_line_conductor` or `underground_line_conductor`)   
conductor_N  | object  | N/A  | Object describing the conductor of phase N in the overhead or underground line object. (`overhead_line_conductor` or `underground_line_conductor`)   
spacing  | object  | N/A  | `line_spacing` object describing how the conductors are physically oriented on the pole or in the bundle.   
z11-z33  | complex  | Ohm/mile  | describes the z-matrix directly for either underground or overhead lines instead of using the geometric configurations (This will over-write geometric configurations). For this notation, index 1 is phase A, 2 is phase B, and 3 is phase C. So element z12 represents the mutual/cross coupling impedance between phase A and phase B of this line configuration.   
c11-c33  | double  | nF/mile  | describes the z-matrix directly for either underground or overhead lines instead of using the geometric configurations (This will over-write geometric configurations). For this notation, index 1 is phase A, 2 is phase B, and 3 is phase C. So element c12 represents the mutual/cross coupling capacitance between phase A and phase B of this line configuration. Unlike the zXX terms, this is raw capacitance and does not have the frequency factored into the calculation yet.   
  
### Line State of Development

Line is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. 

## Line spacing

The line spacing object describe how the individual conductors of a distribution line are arranged underground or on the support pole. A typical implementation of a `line_spacing` object is 
    
    
    object line_spacing {
    	name line_spacing_200;
    	distance_AB 2.5;
    	distance_BC 4.5;
    	distance_AC 7.0;
    	distance_AN 5.656854;
    	distance_BN 4.272002;
    	distance_CN 5.0;
    	}
    

### Line Spacing Parameters

---|---|---|---  
distance_AB  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase A and phase B.   
distance_BC  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase B and phase C.   
distance_AC  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase C and phase A.   
distance_AN  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase A and the neutral phase.   
distance_BN  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase B and the neutral phase.   
distance_CN  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductors of phase C and the neutral phase.   
distance_AE  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductor of phase A and the earth (ground).   
distance_BE  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductor of phase B and the earth (ground).   
distance_CE  | double  | feet  | Distance between conductor of phase C and the earth (ground).

Line Spacing is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. 

## Overhead Line

Overhead lines are one of three specific line types incorporated into the `powerflow` distribution-level module. The `overhead_line` object will take spacing and conductor parameters and translate those values to appropriate impedance matrices based for the specific overhead transmission line configuration. A typical overhead line would be written as 
    
    
    object overhead_line{
    	phases "ABCN";
    	name 701-802;
    	from node_701;
    	to load_802;
    	length 125960;
    	configuration line_config_A;
    	}
    

`overhead_line` objects are based around the `link` object and inherit all of its properties. `overhead_line` objects primarily translate the `configuration` options specified into a circuit equivalent, so not further properties than those provided by `link` are required. 

### Overhead Line State of Development

Overhead Line is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. 

## Overhead Line Conductor

For overhead lines, the `line_configuration` object must specify the overhead line conductor types used in the particular setup. A typical `overhead_line_conductor` would be implemented as 
    
    
    object overhead_line_conductor {
    	name overhead_line_conductor_100;
    	geometric_mean_radius .00446;
    	resistance 1.12;
    	}
    

### Overhead Line Conductor Parameters

### Overhead Line Conductor State of Development

Overhead Line Conductor is considered a highly developed and validated model. 

## Underground Line

Underground lines represent burial distribution cables in a powerflow system. In terms of GridLAB-D implementation, they are nearly identical to the `overhead_line` objects. A typical `underground_line` object would be written as 
    
    
    object underground_line {
    	phases "ABC";
    	name 703-727;
    	from node_703;
    	to load_827;
    	length 240;
    	configuration line_config_7241;
    	}
    

As with `overhead_line` objects, `underground_line` objects inherit all of their properties from the `link` object. The `underground_line` object again serves as a method to choose the appropriate translation algorithms to take the physical parameters of the system and create an equivalent model. As such, it has no new properties either. 

### Underground Line State of Development

Underground Line is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. 

## Underground Line Conductor

Underground lines often contain concentric shielding layers around the central conductor. As a result, they require more parameters than the `overhead_line_conductor` objects to fully describe them. A typical `underground_line_object` is: 
    
    
    object underground_line_conductor { 
    	name ug_conduct_7210;
    	outer_diameter 1.980000;
    	conductor_gmr 0.036800;
    	conductor_diameter 1.150000;
    	conductor_resistance 0.105000;
    	neutral_gmr 0.003310;
    	neutral_resistance 5.903000;
    	neutral_diameter 0.102000;
    	neutral_strands 20.000000;
    	shield_gmr 0.000000;
    	shield_resistance 0.000000;
    	}

rating.winter.emergency  | double  | Amperes  | The emergency (short time) rating for the conductor during winter month usage. **This parameter is unused at this point. Future versions of GridLAB-D may implement this functionality**  
  
### Underground Line Conductor State of Development

Underground Line Conductor is considered a highly developed and validated model. 

## Triplex line

The third type of line available in the `powerflow` module is the triplex lines. Triplex lines represent the distribution wires coming from the transformer into a typical residential home. That is, they are typically composed of one neutral wire and two "hot" wires. Triplex lines require the phase `S` to be specified as part of the `phases` parameter for proper implementation. A typical triplex line would be implemented in a similar fashion to 
    
    
    object triplex_line {
    	phases AS;
    	length 100 ft;	
    	from node_4a;
    	to node_4;
    	configuration triplex_config_AB;
    	}
    

As with the `underground_line` and `overhead_line` objects, `triplex_line` objects inherit all of their properties from the `link` object. However, `triplex_line`s use a different configuration structure than the `overhead_line` and `underground_line` objects. 

### Triplex Line State of Development

Triplex Line is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. 

## Triplex Line Configuration

Triplex lines utilize their own configuration description method. Since the phases are no longer described as `A`, `B`, or `C`, the configuration is relabeled. A typical `triplex_line_configuration` is given as either a geometric configuration 
    
    
    object triplex_line_configuration {
    		conductor_1 trip_cond_H;
    		conductor_2 trip_cond_H;
    		conductor_N trip_cond_N;
    		insulation_thickness 0.08 in;
    		diameter 0.368 in;
    		}
    

or by using an explicit z-matrix 
    
    
    object triplex_line_configuration {
                   z11 1.52+0.61j;
                   z12 +0.55+0.44j;
                   z21 -0.55-0.44j;
                   z22 -1.52-0.61j;
                   }
    

Note: The explicit z-matrix version is an under-determined system. Ground and neutral currents will not be calculated, however, voltage and line currents will be correctly calculated.

## Triplex Conductor

As with the `underground_line` and `overhead_line` objects, `triplex_line` objects have their own conductor objects. This object describes the physical characteristics of the actual wire used in the triple line bundle. A typical implementation would be: 
    
    
    object triplex_line_conductor {
    	name trip_cond_1;
    	resistance 0.97;
    	geometric_mean_radius 0.0111;		
    	}

---|---|---|---

geometric_mean_radius  | double  | feet  | GMR of conductor.   
  
### Triplex Conductor State of Development

## Transformer

Transformers provide a means to change the voltage from one node to another in the distribution system. Similar to the different `line` objects, a `transformer` object requires a configuration object to specify the details of the implementation. A typical transform implementation is 
    
    
    object transformer {
    	name xfrmr_709_775;
    	phases "ABC";
    	from node_709;
    	to node_775;
    	configuration xfrmr_config_400;
    	}
    

### Transformer Thermal/Aging Model

A newly added feature to transformers in 3.0 is a thermal/aging model. New parameters are placed within the transformer and and transformer_configuration in order to use this new feature. An implementation of the thermal model within transformer is 
    
    
    object transformer {
    	name xfrmr_709_775;
    	phases "ABC";
    	from node_709;
    	to node_775;
    	configuration xfrmr_config_400;
            use_thermal_model TRUE;
            climate Seattle;
            aging_granularity 300;
            percent_loss_of_life 20;
    	}

## Transformer Configuration

The `transformer_configuration` object describes the details of a particular transformer implementation. It includes information like the power rating, connection type, and nominal voltage on each side. A typical delta-delta transformer configuration would be implemented as

    	name xfrm_config_400;
    	connect_type DELTA_DELTA;
    	install_type PADMOUNT;

    	}

### Transformer Configuration State of Development

Transformer Configuration is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future, and additional models may be included as needed. 

## Load

Load objects present a method for taking power out of the system in controlled, known amounts. While implemented as a constant load, `player` objects can be used to vary the load with time. `load` objects provide a means to implement constant current, constant power, and constant impedance losses or generation into the system. The convention is a load is a positive quantity, so generation would need to be represented as a negative number. 

Loads can be a mixture of the constant current, constant impedance, and constant power types. A typical, mixed load would be implemented as 
    
    
    object load {
    	phases "ABCD";
    	name 841;
    	constant_current_C -0.586139+9.765222j;
    	constant_impedance_B 221.915014+104.430595j;
    	constant_power_A 42000.000000+21000.000000j;

### Load State of Development

Load is considered a well developed and validated model, with a number of features. Additional features may be included as needed. 

## Meter

Meters provide a measurement point for power and energy on the system at a specific point. Coupled with a `recorder` or `collector`, the `meter` object provides a method determine how much power and energy have been used by downstream connections, as well as how much current is flowing through the meter object at the present time. A typical implementation would be 
    
    
    object meter {
    	name Mtr1;
    	phases ABC;
    	nominal_voltage 4800.0;
    	}

### Meter State of Development

Meter is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models using billing features have not been fully validated. 

## Triplex Node

Triplex nodes represent special cases of the `node` object. The `triplex_node` object still serves as connection point between different links of the system and a point of measurable voltage. However, `triplex_node`s are casted to represent phases `1`, `2`, and `N` rather than `A`, `B`, and `C` like normal `node` objects. Simplified, they operate in the split-phase level of distribution rather than the three-phase level. 

Since `load` objects are directly derived from `node` objects, they are only valid for three-phase connections as well. Therefore, the `load` functionality has been built into the `triplex_load` object for split-phase level systems. 

It is important to note that triplex-based objects should include the phase `S` somewhere in their designation. 

A typical `triplex_node` implementation is 
    
    
    object triplex_node {
    	name TPL_tAS;
    	phases AS;
    	voltage_1 120 + 0j;		
    	voltage_2 120 + 0j;
    	voltage_N 0;
    	current_1  1.0;
    	power_1 1000+2000j;	
    	shunt_1 5.3333e-004 -2.6667e-004i;	
    	nominal_voltage 120;
    	};
    

### Triplex Node Parameters

### Triplex Meter State of Development

Triplex Meter is considered a highly developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models using billing have not been fully validated. Additional features will be added as needed. 

## Triplex Load

Triplex load is similar to `load` and `ZIPload` in that load can be specified as a direct value, or as a base load, then a ZIP fraction applied to that base load. The load can be placed on phase 1 (120V), phase 2 (120V) or phase 12 (240V). Much like the `load` object, `player` objects can be used to vary the load with time. `triplex_load` objects provide a means to implement constant current, constant power, and constant impedance losses or generation into the system. The convention is a load is a positive quantity, so generation would need to be represented as a negative number. 

Loads can be a mixture of the constant current, constant impedance, and constant power types. A typical, mixed load would be implemented as 
    
    
    object triplex_load {
    	phases "AS";
    	name tplex_load;
    	constant_current_1 -0.586139+9.765222j;
    	constant_impedance_2 221.915014+104.430595j;
    	constant_power_12 4200.00+2100.00j;

### Triplex Load State of Development

Triplex_load is considered a well developed and validated model, with a number of features. Additional features may be included as needed. 

## Regulator

Regulators are essentially tap-changing transformers that attempt to maintain a voltage level at a specified point in the system. Regulators are one of two objects in the `powerflow` module that incorporate a form of automatic control. To take full advantage of this functionality, simulations of greater than one time step (time-varying simulations) are recommended. Similar to `transformer` and `line` objects, regulators require a `regulator_configuration` to determine many of their operating parameters. 

A typical implementation would be 
    
    
    object regulator {
    	name Reg799781;
    	phases "ABC";
    	from node_799;
    	to node_781;
    	configuration reg_conf_79978101;
    	}
    

### Regulator Parameters

A `regulator` object is a derived class from `link` objects. Therefore, all of the parameters available to the `link` object apply here as well.

tap_B  | int16  | N/A  | Position of the tap on phase `B` of a wye-connected or phase `BC` of a delta-connected system. This parameter is most useful to be read in automatic regulator modes, but serves as the input for tap position of the phase under the manual control scheme.   
tap_C  | int16  | N/A  | Position of the tap on phase `C` of a wye-connected or phase `CA` of a delta-connected system. This parameter is most useful to be read in automatic regulator modes, but serves as the input for tap position of the phase under the manual control scheme.   
sense_node  | object  | N/A  | Remote node for the automatic control method to monitor. Only utilized in `REMOTE_NODE` control scheme. This must be a `node`-based object to work properly.

tap_C_change_count  | int16  | N/A  | Holds the number of times the tap position on phase `C` of a wye-connected or phase `CA` of a delta-connected system has changed.   
  
### Regulator State of Development

Regulator is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. Additional configurations, controls, and/or losses may be included as needed. 

## Regulator Configuration

The `regulator_configuration` object describes the details of a particular `regulator` object implementation. This includes details such as the control scheme, regulator type, sensing information, and time delays. A typical regulator configuration would look similar to 
    
    
    object regulator_configuration {
    	name reg_conf_79978101;
    	connect_type 2;
    	band_center 122.000;

    	compensator_r_setting_B 1.5;
    	compensator_x_setting_B 3.0;

    	tap_pos_A 7;
    	tap_pos_B 4;
    	}

### Regulator Configuration State of Development

Regulator Configuration is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. Additional configurations, controls, and/or losses may be included as needed. 

## Capacitor

Capacitors are used for reactive power compensation and voltage support scenarios. The `capacitor` implements a switchable set of capacitors. `capacitor` objects are one of two objects in the `powerflow` module that incorporate a form of automatic control. To take full advantage of this functionality, simulations of greater than one time step (time-varying simulations) are recommended. Single-phase powerflow connections (phase `S`) are not supported by capacitors at this time. A typical capacitor implementation is 
    
    
    object capacitor {
    	phases ABCN;
    	name CapNode;
    	phases_connected ABCD;
    	control MANUAL;

    	switchA OPEN;
    	switchB OPEN;
    	switchC CLOSED;
    	nominal_voltage 7200;
    	}
    

### Capacitor Parameters

`capacitor` objects are derived from `node` objects, so any parameters of the `node` object are available as well. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
pt_phase  | set  | N/A  | Determines the participating phases. These are the phases the various control schemes will monitor to determine their actions. Follows the same conventions as the overall `phases` property in powerflow.   
phases_connected  | set  | N/A  | Connection of the capacitors. This allows for delta-connected capacitors on a wye-connected system and vice versa. Follows the same conventions as the overall `phases` property. If left empty or undefined, defaults to the `phases` property of the capacitor.

  * `MANUAL` \- Capacitor switching is controlled manually through `switchA`, `switchB`, and `switchC`.
  * `VAR` \- VAR controlled mode. A remote line needs to be specified in `remote_sense` or `remote_sense_B` that will have its reactive power checked against `VAr_set_high` and `VAr_set_low`.
  * `VOLT` \- Voltage controlled mode. The capacitor node itself or a node specified by `remote_sense` or `remote_sense_B` has its voltage checked against `voltage_set_high` and `voltage_set_low`.
  * `VARVOLT` \- Combination control scheme. Has two modes. If `voltage_set_low` is specified, performs control similar to `VOLT` first, and then `VAR` second. If `voltage_set_low` is unspecified or set to zero, operates in `VAR` mode primarily. However, `voltage_set_high` is monitored and will switch the capacitors off and lock them out if exceeded (voltage safety).

  
voltage_set_high  | double  | Volts  | High setpoint for voltage-based capacitor switching operations. This setpoint will turn the capacitors off.   
voltage_set_low  | double  | Volts  | Low setpoint for voltage-based capacitor switching operations. This setpoint will turn the capacitors on.

cap_nominal_voltage  | double  | Volts  | Capacitor rated nominal voltage. Used for situations when `nominal_voltage` doesn't match the rated voltage or if a line-to-line voltage is specified when the capacitors are on a wye-connected system. If left blank, defaults to the `nominal_voltage` specified.   
time_delay  | double  | seconds  | Time delay before any capacitor switching operation takes place. Represents mechanical switching delays.   
dwell_time  | double  | seconds  | Time period a switching operation must be consistently requested before any switching operation is attempted. Serves as a transient filter or additional hysteresis to prevent transient events from causing excessive capacitor switching.

remote_sense  | object  | N/A  | Remote `node` or `link` object for `VOLT`, `VAR`, or `VARVOLT` control schemes. If a `node` object is specified, the remote voltage is read. If `link` object is specified, the reactive power is read.   
remote_sense_B  | object  | N/A  | Remote `node` or `link` object for `VOLT`, `VAR`, or `VARVOLT` control schemes. If a `node` object is specified, the remote voltage is read. If `link` object is specified, the reactive power is read. Under the `VARVOLT` control scheme, this must be the opposite of the type specified in `remote_sense`.   
control_level  | enumeration  | N/A  | Specifies how the switching action occurs for all phases of the capacitor. Valid keywords are 

  * `BANK` \- All capacitors are switched based on the control scheme and `pt_phase` property.
  * `INDIVIDUAL` \- Capacitors are switched individually based on the control scheme and `pt_phase` property.

  
  
### Capacitor State of Development

Capacitor is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models may be developed to include more advanced features in the future. Additional configurations and controls may be included as needed. 

## Fuse

Fuse objects are used to place a current limitation between two nodes. If the current is exceeded, the fuse will open and prevent further current flow. Due to limitations in the Forward-Back Sweep algorithm, fuses only affect the first downstream node. If other loads exist downstream, they will cause an oscillatory voltage swing that has no real representation. ` reliability` module functionality only exists in the Newton-Raphson solver at this time. A minimalist `fuse` could be implemented as 
    
    
    object fuse {
    	 phases "ABC";
    	 name node1-node2;
    	 from node1;
    	 to node2;
    	 }
    

A typical `fuse` object would be implemented, with the same parameters as above, as 
    
    
    object fuse {
     	phases "ABC";
     	name node1-node2;
     	from node1;
     	to node2;
     	current_limit 9999.0 A;
     	mean_replacement_time 3600.0;
    	repair_dist_type NONE;
     	}
    

### Fuse Parameters

`fuse` objects are derived from `link` objects, so all of those properties are available. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
current_limit  | double  | Amperes  | Current rating for the fuse. If exceeded, the particular phase will go to an open circuit condition.   
mean_replacement_time  | double  | seconds  | Mean time to replace the fuse if blown. This could represent a travel requirement (remote location) or scarcity requirement (shipping time for parts). This value overrides any value specified in `mean_repair_time` for the `link` object itself.   
phase_A_status  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the fuse on phase `A` (only valid if phase `A` is in the `phases` property). Two keywords are valid: 

  * GOOD - The fuse on phase `A` is still conducting and has not exceeded its current limit.
  * BLOWN - The fuse on phase `A` has exceeded its current limit and is no longer conducting.

  
phase_B_status  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the fuse on phase `B` (only valid if phase `B` is in the `phases` property). Two keywords are valid: 

  * GOOD - The fuse on phase `B` is still conducting and has not exceeded its current limit.
  * BLOWN - The fuse on phase `B` has exceeded its current limit and is no longer conducting.

  
phase_C_status  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the fuse on phase `C` (only valid if phase `C` is in the `phases` property). Two keywords are valid: 

  * GOOD - The fuse on phase `C` is still conducting and has not exceeded its current limit.
  * BLOWN - The fuse on phase `C` has exceeded its current limit and is no longer conducting.

  
repair_dist_type  | enumeration  | N/A  | Distribution to be used after a fuse has blow to restore it. Current valid settings are: 

  * `NONE` \- No distribution is used and the value in `mean_replacement_time` is taken directly.
  * `EXPONENTIAL` \- An exponential distribution is used with `mean_replacement_time` taken as one over the lambda value.

  
  
### Fuse State of Development

Fuse is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions. Reliability functionality has been tested and validated, but is not fully vetted and may change as advanced functionality is included. 

## Switch

Switch objects are used to change topology and add or remove elements from a powerflow system. When a switch is opened, no current flow is permitted and the downstream objects will be effectively removed from the system. A typical switch implementation is 
    
    
    object switch {
    	name switch1;
    	phases ABCN;
    	from node_250;
    	to node_243;
    	status CLOSED;
    	}
    

### Switch Parameters

Switch objects are derived from `link` objects and share all of those available parameters. `switch` objects have additional parameters of 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
phase_A_state  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the phase A portion of the switch. Valid states are: 

  * `OPEN` \- `switch` is open and no current can flow
  * `CLOSED` \- `switch` is closed and conducting

  
phase_B_state  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the phase B portion of the switch. Valid states are: 

  * `OPEN` \- `switch` is open and no current can flow
  * `CLOSED` \- `switch` is closed and conducting

  
phase_C_state  | enumeration  | N/A  | Status of the phase C portion of the switch. Valid states are: 

  * `OPEN` \- `switch` is open and no current can flow
  * `CLOSED` \- `switch` is closed and conducting

  
operating_mode  | enumeration  | N/A  | Switching operations governing criterion. Two settings are available: 

  * `INDIVIDUAL` \- each phase of the `switch` object is controlled individually.
  * `BANKED` \- all valid phases of the `switch` object are controlled together. A voting scheme of valid phases is used to determine this. For example, if a `switch` has phases A, B, and C with only phase C closed, phase A and B will override it and open phase A.

  
  
### Switch State of Development

Switch is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of powerflow solutions, however, models incorporating fault analysis, reliability, and other advanced features have not been validated. 

## Recloser

`recloser` objects are a special type of `switch` that open at the detection of a fault condition and will close if the fault condition is removed or isolated within a certain period of time. The time is typically determined by the number of closing tries and the time between tries. `recloser` objects work with both the `FBS` and `NR` solver methods, but their reliability functionality only works with the `NR` method. A typical recloser implementation is 
    
    
    object recloser {
        name recloser_2;
        phases "ABCN";
        from node_2a;
        to node_2b;
        retry_time 1s;
        max_number_of_tries 3;
    }
    

Recloser objects inherit for switch and therefore share all parameters belonging to both `switch` and `link`. `recloser` objects are exercised only by the `reliability` module at this time. 

### Recloser Parameters

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
retry_time  | double  | seconds  | The time to wait in seconds before trying to close after a fault condition is detected. This parameter is unused at this time and is put in place for future functionality.   
maximum_number_of_tries  | double  | unitless  | the maximum number of times the `recloser` tries to close and fails before it permanently opens.   
number_of_tries  | double  | unitless  | number of tries a `recloser` has been actuated in the current fault condition.   
  
### Recloser State of Development

Recloser is considered a validated model in terms of powerflow solutions and `reliability` integration. However, testing has been limited and feature additions may still be necessary. 

## Relay

Relays are used to provide momentary breaks in the system and are implemented as reclosers. A `relay` object only functions in on a basic level and does not provide any `reliability`-module-functionality at this time. It is untested in the `NR` solver and a `recloser` object is suggested instead. A typical relay would be implemented as 
    
    
    object relay {
    	name recloser_A;
    	phases ABCN;
    	from node_1;
    	to load_5;
    	time_to_change 1.0s;
    	recloser_delays 5.0s;
    	recloser_tries 5;
    	}
    
    

### Relay Parameters

`relay` objects are derived from `link` objects, so all of those parameters should be available. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
time_to_change  | double  | seconds  | Time to physically change out or reset the relay/recloser after it has locked out. **Note: This feature is unimplemented at this time.**  
recloser_delay  | double  | seconds  | Time from a trip before the `recloser` will attempt to close the circuit again.   
recloser_tries  | int16  | N/A  | Number of reclosing attempts before the `recloser` object will lock in the open position.   
  
### Relay State of Development

Relay is considered a well developed and validated model in terms of `FBS`-based powerflow solutions, however, models incorporating fault analysis, reliability, and other advanced features have not been validated. 

## Substation

Substations were used to connect distribution powerflow in the `powerflow` module with PowerWorld through the `network` module. The `substation` object converts the sequence voltage provided by the `network` module to three-phase swing bus voltage for the unbalanced three-phase powerflow solution. The `substation` object also passes the unbalanced three-phase powerflow solution to back to the `network` module as an single power value representing the average load on all three phases of the swing bus. Furthermore, the `substation` object sets which phase is the reference phase for the distribution powerflow. A typical substation implementation is 
    
    
    object substation {
    	name SubS;
    	bustype SWING;
            parent network_node;
            reference_PHASE_A;
            phase ABCN;
    	nominal_voltage 7199.558;
    }
    

In order to properly connect the substation object to the `network` module, the substation object's parent must be a pw_load object. 

### Substation Parameters

The `substation` object is derived from the `node` object in the `powerflow` module. As a result, all parameters of that object are definable as well.

transmission_level_constant_impedance_load  | complex  | Ohms  | The positive-sequence constant impedance load to be posted directly to the pw_load object ([powerflow] solver does not handle this, it is explicitly converted and posted to PowerWorld's solver).

distribution_power_B  | complex  | Volts-Amperes  | The measured power of the attached powerflow on phase B.   
distribution_power_C  | complex  | Volts-Amperes  | The measured power of the attached powerflow on phase C.   
  
### Substation State of Development

The only transmission powerflow software that substation currently works with is PowerWorld. Please note that the specific the transmission current and impedance loads are converted to complex power values first and then posted to the proper properties(load_current and load_impedance) in the pw_load object. The average_transmission_power_load value must be added to the average_distribution_load before posting to pw_load(load_power). 

Substation's three phase voltages are determined differently dependent upon three scenarios. If there is a pw_load object attached to the substation object, then the three phase voltages are determined by the sequence voltage value read from the pw_load object. The three phase voltages are determined by the positive_sequence_voltage property if there is a player object populating that property in the absence of a pw_load object. In the absence of a player object and a pw_load object, the three phase voltages are determined by user input or the substation object's powerflow parent just like any node object. If there is no pw_load connected to the substation then the substation doesn't post the average_distribution_load, average_transmission_current_load, average_transmission_impedance_load, and average_transmission_power_load properties. 

## Parametric Load

Parametric loads provide a `load`-like object that allows the load to vary based on other conditions in the system. This may be things such as weather conditions or even time-of-day scheduling. Further details on parametric loads can be found in the [Industrial and agricultural loads] page. A typical parametric load would be called as 
    
    
    object pqload {
    	name pqload1;
    	phases ABC;
    	Zp 200 ohm;
    	Zq_T 250 F;
    	Im 300;
    	Ia 45;
    	Pp 100;
    	Pp_T 3;
    	Pq_T 1;
    	nominal_voltage 2400;
    	}
    

### Parametric Load Parameters

The `pqload` object is directly derived from the `load` object and thus derived from the `node` object as well. As such, parameters of those two objects are also available for use, but most `load` parameters will probably be overwritten.

### PQ Load State of Development

PQ Load is considered an experimental model and has not been validated at this time. 

## Volt-VAr Control

With multiple feeders attached to a common point, it is often useful to coordinate the voltage regulators and capacitors on the system. The `volt_var_control` object coordinates selected `regulator` and `capacitor` objects on the system. Using voltage measurements at `node` object points, the `volt_var_control` tries to maintain a desired voltage. In addition to voltage measurements, the `volt_var_control` utilizes a power measurement at a `link` object to determine how to switch various `capacitor` objects on the system in and out of service. Due to differences in the timing of power calculations in the Forward-Back Sweep and Newton-Raphson powerflow solvers, capacitors may switch at slightly different intervals for the same system. The overall control behaves the same in both solver methods, but this difference in capacitor timing may result in different final operating points. A typical Volt-VAr Controller implementation is 
    
    
    object volt_var_control {
    	name IVVC37;
    	control_method ACTIVE;
    	capacitor_delay 10.0;
    	regulator_delay 5.0;
    	desired_pf 0.98;
    	d_max 0.8;
    	d_min 0.1;
    	substation_link "SubTransNode-799";
    	regulator_list "reg799-781,regnode799-U0081";
    	capacitor_list "CapNode_A,CapNode_B";
    	voltage_measurements "load829,1,load841,1,load825,1,U0029,2,U0041,2,U0025,2";
    	minimum_voltages 2500.0;
    	maximum_voltages 3000.0;
    	desired_voltages 2600.0;
    }
    

Many of the parameters on the Volt-VAr Controller can be left unspecified. When unspecified, default values or criteria are enacted. A minimalist implemenation would look similar to 
    
    
    object volt_var_control {
    	name IVVC37;
    	regulator_list "reg799-781,regnode799-U0081";
    	capacitor_list "CapNode_A,CapNode_B";
    }
    

### Volt-VAr Control Parameters

The `volt_var_control` object only derives properties from general `powerflow` module sets. It may share similar names to `node` and `link` parameters, but it is not a subclass of either of these objects. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
control_method  | enumeration  | N/A  | Defines the control scheme the `volt_var_control` object is currently operating in. There are two modes currently supported: 

  * `STANDBY` \- The `volt_var_control` is inactive and all `regulator` and `capacitor` control is handled by their local definitions.
  * `ACTIVE` \- The `volt_var_control` is actively adjusting the regulators of interest, as well as coordinating capacitor insertions and removals. This is the default state.

  
capacitor_delay  | double  | seconds  | Default delay for any `capacitor`s under the `volt_var_control` object's control. If a delay is not explicitly defined in the `capacitor`'s local properties, this value will be used as the time delay for all switching operations. Defaults to 5.0 seconds.   
regulator_delay  | double  | seconds  | Default delay for any `regulator`s under the `volt_var_control` object's control. If a delay is not explicityly defined in the `regulator_configuration` object association with the `regulator`, this value will be used as the time delay in all tap-changing operations. Defaults to 5.0 seconds.   
desired_pf  | double  | N/A  | Desired power-factor for the system to try and achieve. Used for setting threshold values for switching `capacitor`s in and out of the system. The power factor is determined at the `substation_link` object. Defaults to 0.98.   
d_max  | double  | N/A  | Scaling constant for switching the `capacitor`s on as a ratio of their size to the required reactive power correction. Typically between 0.3 and 0.6. It must not overlap with `d_min`, and a larger spread between the two values helps prevent `capacitor` switching oscillations. Defaults to 0.6.   
d_min  | double  | N/A  | Scaling constant for switching the `capacitor`s off as a ratio of their size and the required reactive power correction. Typically between 0.1 and 0.4. It must not overlap with `d_max`. As with `d_max`, a larger spread between `d_min` and `d_max` will help prevent `capacitor` switching oscillations. Defaults to 0.3.   
substation_link  | object  | N/A  | Defines the `link` to extract power information from for power factor correction. This object must be of the main-type `link`. Typically, this will be attached to a subtransmission-level `transformer` object to monitor reactive power for the entire network. If unpopulated, this defaults to monitoring the power through the first regulator specified in `regulator_list`.   
pf_phase  | set  | N/A  | Defines the phases of `substation_link` to monitor and accumulate for the power factor calculations. `pf_phase` can be any combination of `PHASE_A`, `PHASE_B`, or `PHASE_C`. If left blank, `pf_phase` will default to the phases of the `substation_link` object.   
regulator_list  | char1024  | Regulator objects (implied)  | List of regulators for the `volt_var_control` object to control. The list is a comma-separated object name for each regulator for which control is desired. No trailing comma is required. One regulator would be specified as `regulator_list reg799781;`, while three would be `regulator_list reg799781,reg981,reg01;`.   
capacitor_list  | char1024  | Capacitor objects (implied)  | List of capacitors for the `volt_var_control` object to control. This list is also comma-separated, like the `regulator_list`. If no capacitors are specified, no reactive adjustments are performed. All capacitors are operated in banked mode by the `volt_var_control` object. The listed capacitors are sorted by size and distance for switching operations. An example capacitor list is `capacitor_list CapA,CapB,CapC`.   
voltage_measurements  | char1024  | Objects (implied)  | List of end-of-line measurements for the `volt_var_control` to use in `regulator` control. This list is comma-separated, like the `capacitor_list` and `regulator_list`. If left blank, the measurement point defaults to load side of each `regulator` in `regulator_list`. The list can take two formats, depending on the number of regulators: 

  * One regulator - The list is a comma-separated list of just the object names. No regulator designation is necessary, since only one regulator is present. An example is
    `measurement_list NodeA,NodeB,NodeC,NodeD;`.

  * One or more regulators - The list is a comma-separated list of object names, and their associated regulator. All measurements must be represented as a pair in the list. The first item is the object name, and the second item is the `regulator` position in the `regulator_list` variable. For example,
    `measurement_list NodeA,1,NodeC,2,NodeB,1;` will assign `NodeA` and `NodeB` to regulator 1, and `NodeC` to regulator 2. Notice these can occur in any regulator order, as long as the second portion of the data pair is the regulator number.  
minimum_voltages  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of minimum voltages for the `volt_var_control` object to maintain. If only 1 value is specified, this value will be used for all `regulator`s in `regulator_list`. A value can be specified for each `regulator` as a comma-separated list. For example, to specify two minimum voltage levels for two different regulators, use `minimum_voltages 2600,2500;`. If left blank, the minimimum voltage is set at 0.95 p.u. of the `regulator`'s TO node `nominal_voltage`.   
maximum_voltages  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of maximum voltages for the `volt_var_control` object to maintain. If only 1 value is specified, this value will be used for all `regulator`s in `regulator_list`. A value can be specified for each `regulator` as a comma-separated list. For example, to specify two maximum voltage levels for two different regulators, use `maximum_voltages 4500,4400;`. If left blank, the maximimum voltage is set at 1.05 p.u. of the `regulator`'s TO node `nominal_voltage`.   
desired_voltages  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of desired, or target voltages for the `volt_var_control` object to maintain. If only 1 value is specified, this value will be used for all `regulator`s in `regulator_list`. A value can be specified for each `regulator` as a comma-separated list. For example, to specify two desired voltage levels for two different regulators, use `desired_voltages 4500,4400;`. If left blank, the desired voltage is set at the `regulator`'s TO node `nominal_voltage`.   
max_vdrop  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of voltage drop thresholds for high or low loading operation (selection of `high_load_deadband` or `low_load_deadband` for a regulator). If the voltage drop between the regulator and the lowest end-of-line measurement is greater than `max_vdrop`, the corresponding `high_load_deadband` is used. Otherwise, the corresponding `low_load_deadband` is used. `max_vdrop` can be a comma-separated list of values for each regulator of `regulator_list`. if only one value is specified, that value will be used for all regulators. If left blank, `max_vdrop` defaults to 1.5x the corresponding `regulator` object's step up tap voltage value.   
high_load_deadband  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of tap-changing bandwidth thresholds for high loading operation (as determined by `max_vdrop`). `high_load_deadband` represents a +/- `high_load_deadband` deadband around the desired voltage before a tap change is requested on the regulator. This can be specified for each regulator as a comma-separated list. If a single value is specified, that value will be used on all `regulator`s in the `regulator_list`. If unspecified, `high_load_deadband` defaults to the voltage value associated with a single tap change on the `regulator`.   
low_load_deadband  | char1024  | Volts (implied)  | List of tap-changing bandwidth thresholds for low loading operation (as determined by `max_vdrop`). `low_load_deadband` represents a +/- `low_load_deadband` deadband around the desired voltage before a tap change is requested on the regulator. This can be specified for each regulator as a comma-separated list. If a single value is specified, that value will be used on all `regulator`s in the `regulator_list`. If unspecified, `low_load_deadband` defaults to the voltage value associated with a two tap change on the `regulator` (2x the default of `high_load_deadband`).   
  
### VoltVar Control State of Development

VoltVar Control is considered a well developed model, but has not been fully validated at this time. Advanced features and additional controls may be added as needed.

    object impedance_dump {
    	filename impedance_output.xml;
    }
    

Like other "dump" objects in powerflow, additional parameters can be added to describe when to run (runtime) and for only link objects with a specific groupid: 
    
    
    object impedance_dump {
        group "class=overhead_line";
        runtime '2020-12-11 01:00:00';

## Bill Dump

Similar to `voltdump`, `billdump` allows users to generate a single file where all customers' bills are written from `triplex_meter` to a single output file in a similar format 

meter_name,  | previous_monthly_bill,  | previous_monthly_energy   
---|---|---  
triplex_meter_1,  | 154.30 ($),  | 1205 (kWh)   
triplex_meter_2,  | 105.10 ($),  | 821 (kWh)

    object billdump {
           filename bill_1.csv;
           }
    

where the previous month's energy and bill for all triplex meters within the system will be placed into bill_1.csv. Additional parameters can be added to describe when to run (runtime) and for only meters with a specific groupid: 
    
    
    object billdump {
        group "Residential_tm_solar";
        runtime '2012-04-01 01:00:00';
        filename residential_solar_bill.csv;
    }
    

### Bill Dump Parameters

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
filename  | char32  | N/A  | Tells the object what file to print all information to. While a *.csv is not necessary, it is recommended as the formatted output is in *.csv format.   
group  | char32  | N/A  | Using the `groupid` feature, this allows only triplex meters with the matching `groupid` to be dumped into the output file. If this is not specified, every triplex meter in the system will be recorded.   
runtime  | timestamp  | N/A  | Tells the object at what time to output the bills of the system. Can be in either seconds from epoch (Unix time) or with a timestamp ('2006-01-01 00:00:00'). If not specified, the default is immediately after the first time step solution.   
  
### Bill Dump State of Development

Bill Dump is considered a well developed, but unvalidated model. Additional features may be included as needed. 

## Fault Check

The `fault_check` object performs "support/islanding checks" on objects inside the `powerflow` module. Its primary purpose is to determine if a particular node or link is still in service after a reconfiguration or fault event. `fault_check` is set up to operate as an independent topology checking object, but does have ties to the `reliability` module and the `restoration` object's functionality. The `fault_check` object only works with the `NR` `solver_method` at this time. Other solvers may be incorporated at a later date. A typical `fault_check` object would be implemented as 
    
    
    object fault_check {
    	name fault_check_obj;
    	check_mode ONCHANGE;
    	output_filename outage_check.txt;
    	}
    

As with other objects, not all of the parameters need to be specified. A minimal implementation would be similar to 
    
    
    object fault_check {
    	name fault_check_obj;
    	}
    

### Fault Check Parameters

The `fault_check` object only derives the base `powerflow` module properties. However, these `powerflow`-based properties are not needed and are omitted from the list below. 

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
check_mode  | enumeration  | N/A  | Defines the fault checking scheme utilized. Valid entries are 

  * `SINGLE` \- Fault checks and voltage support checks are only performed once, before the first solver pass of the `NR` solver.
  * `ONCHANGE` \- Fault checks and voltage support checks are performed any time an admittance change is flagged on the `NR` solver.
  * `ALL` \- Fault checks and voltage support checks are performed on every iteration
  * `SINGLE_DEBUG` \- Fault checks and voltage support checks are only done once, at the very beginning of the simulation. This mode will terminate the simulation after doing the initial fault check. This mode also bypasses several "critical errors" that would ordinarily terminate the simulation immediately, to allow for debugging the topology better (e.g., an islanded single node).
  * `SWITCHING` \- Special variant of `ONCHANGE` used with manipulation of `switch` objects and external interfaces. May be deprecated in the future.

  
output_filename  | char1024  | N/A  | File name for the text file of support check status values. Will output the bus number, phase information, and island association (if relevant) at each timestamp the `fault_check` object runs. If `full_output_file` is set, this will include both supported and unsupported node lists.   
reliability_mode  | bool  | N/A  | Boolean flag to indicate if the `fault_check` object is running in a `reliability`-module-based mode. `Reliability` will toggle this mode and it is only provided for user information, it is not a specifiable property.   
eventgen_object  | object  | N/A  | Object link to an `eventgen` object in the `reliability` module. This object will be used to implement any "unscheduled" faults, such as switch openings or fuses blowing. Without this object specified, such objects will still open or trip, but may result in an unsolvable system matrix and prematurely terminate the simulation.   
strictly_radial  | bool  | N/A  | Boolean flag to indicate which topology checking algorithm to use. Defaults to `true`, indicating a radial system is represented. If set `true`, line from/to fields are explicitly utilized. If set to `false`, a algorithm supporting meshed topologies and arbitrary from/to designations is supported. Note: the meshed topology check is more exhaustive and slower, hence the option for when feeders are known to 100% be radial.   
full_output_file  | bool  | N/A  | Boolean flag to toggle what gets written to `output_filename`. Defaults to `false`, which will only output unsupported nodes in the output. If set to `true`, it will provide a list of unsupported and supported nodes. Useful with `grid_association` to see what island a node is associated.   
grid_association  | bool  | N/A  | Boolean flag to indicate if the island association checking is performed. This option must be enabled in multiple islands or multiple independent SWING node scenarios. If `false`, only the "primary SWING" node will be checked for topology continuity -- all other SWING-type nodes will be ignored and removed from service (if not connected to the primary SWING topology). When enabled, overrides `strictly_radial` to `false`.   
  
### Fault Check State of Development

The `fault_check` object has been rigorously tested for topology checking and islanding operations and is considered well-developed and validated on that functionality. The original implementation was developed in conjunction with the `reliability` module and the `restoration` object. That functionality has been tested and is considered validated, but rigorous testing has not been conducted and additional features may be added at a future date.

## Restoration

As the `powerflow` module interacts with the `reliability` module, portions of the system may become isolated. The `restoration` object attempts to do feeder reconfiguration to close the isolated sections back into the system. The `restoration` object requires `reliability` or some reliability-like actions to function properly, as well as the `fault_check` object. The `restoration` object only works with the `NR` solver method at this time. 

A `restoration` object can be implemented as: 
    
    
    object restoration {
    	name RestorVal;
    	reconfig_attempts 3;
    	reconfig_iteration_limit 5;
    	populate_tree TRUE;
    	}
    

### Restoration Parameters

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
reconfig_attempts  | double  | Tries  | Number of reconfiguration attempts a system will perform before giving up and determining the system can not be fully restored at that condition.   
reconfig_interation_limit  | double  | count  | Number of `powerflow` iterations a particular reconfiguration can try before failing. Used to prevent infinite iterating by the solver.   
populate_tree  | boolean  | N/A  | Flag to populate the tree structure of the feeder. Used for the algorithm implmeented to increase reconfiguration iterations and attempts. Should be set to `TRUE` whenever `reconfiguration` is used.   
  
### Restoration State of Development

The `restoration` object is considered highly experimental at this time. 

## Series Reactor

The series reactor is a link object designed to model a series reactance on each of the three phases. 
    
    
    object series_reactor {
           from node1;
           to node2;
           phases ABC;
           phase_A_impedance 1+1j;
           phase_B_resistance 2;
           phase_C_reactance 3;
    }
    

### Series Reactor Parameters

Property Name  | Type  | Unit  | Description   
---|---|---|---  
phase_A_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series impedance on phase `A`.   
phase_A_resistance  | double  | Ohm  | Series resistance on phase `A`. Maps directly into phase_A_impedance, but allows user to specify real portion separately.   
phase_A_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series reactance on phase `A`. Maps directly into phase_A_impedance, but allows user to specify reactive portion separately.   
phase_B_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series impedance on phase `B`.   
phase_B_resistance  | double  | Ohm  | Series resistance on phase `B`. Maps directly into phase_B_impedance, but allows user to specify real portion separately.   
phase_B_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series reactance on phase `B`. Maps directly into phase_B_impedance, but allows user to specify reactive portion separately.   
phase_C_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series impedance on phase `C`.   
phase_C_resistance  | double  | Ohm  | Series resistance on phase `C`. Maps directly into phase_C_impedance, but allows user to specify real portion separately.   
phase_C_impedance  | double  | Ohm  | Series reactance on phase `C`. Maps directly into phase_C_impedance, but allows user to specify reactive portion separately.   
rated_current_limit  | double  | Amps  | Rated current limit for the reactor. Not used at this time.   
  
### Series Reactor State of Development

Series reactor has been tested, but not fully validated. 

## Sectionalizer

`sectionalizer` objects provide a means to isolate faulted portions of a system. `sectionalizer` objects work in conjuction with the `reliability` module and the `recloser` objects. `reliability` will automatically open a `sectionalizer` if an upstream `recloser` is present, and has "tries" available. `sectionalizer` objects should work for both solver methods, but the `reliability` functionality only works in the `NR` solver. 

A minimal `sectionalizer` implementation is: 
    
    
    object sectionalizer {
    	name Test_Section;
    	phases ABC;
    	}
    

with an equivalent representation of: 
    
    
    object sectionalizer {
    	name Test_Section;
    	phases ABC;
    	phase_A_state CLOSED;
    	phase_B_state CLOSED;
    	phase_C_state CLOSED;
    	operating_mode BANKED;
    	}
    

`sectionalizer` objects behave exactly like `switch` objects, aside from their `reliability` coordination. `sectionalizer` objects inherit all `switch` properties and default to a banked operation mode. No new parameters are introduced in sectionalizers. 

### Sectionalizer State of Development

`sectionalizer` objects are based on `switch` objects and share a common state of development. NOrmal operation is tested and verified. `reliability`-based actions are validated, but not fully tested at this time. 

## Power Metrics

The `power_metrics` object is used by the `reliability` module to calculate relevant `powerflow` metrics. The `power_metrics` object calculates the IEEE 1366-2003 metrics for evaluating the reliability indices of a power system. 

A minimalist `power_metrics` implementation is 
    
    
    object power_metrics {
    	name PwrMetrics;
    	}
    

with an equivalent of 
    
    
    object power_metrics {
    	name PwrMetrics;
    	base_time_value 60.0;
    	}
    

`power_metrics` objects are primarily output objects. 

### Power Metrics Parameters

`power_metrics` objects do not inherit properties from any module. Individual metrics are described in the `reliability` user's guide and in the IEEE 1366-2003 standard.

MAIFI_int  | double  | Customer momentary interruptions over total customers served  | The interval-long computed value of the Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index. The interval is defined by the `base_time_Value` property.   
base_time_value  | double  | seconds  | Interval duration for IEEE 1366-2003 statistics to be computed. This information is the basis for any time calculations. For example, the interruption duration for a CAIDI calculation can be interruptions per hour, interruptions per minute, or any other time base. `base_time_value` dictates this base for the calculations. The value defaults to 1 minute.   
  
### Power Metrics State of Development

The `power_metrics` object is tested and validated with the `reliability` module. However, it has not been fully validated and is considered experimental at this time.
