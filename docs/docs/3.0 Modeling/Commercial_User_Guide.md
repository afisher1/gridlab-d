### Default Office

The "default office" is an incomplete construct. The minimum definition for an office object includes: 
    
    
    object office{
       floor_height 6 ft;
       floor_area 4000 sf;
       interior_mass 2000;
       interior_UA 2.0;
       exterior_UA 2.0;
       hvac.cooling.capacity -4500; // must be negative
       hvac.heating.capacity 4500;
    }
    

### Office Schedule

The office has a built-in occupancy schedule subsystem that is used to determine the minimum air change coefficient. This subsystem parses a string and constructs a bitfield for the hours of each day that the building should be occupied. By default, office buildings are occupied from 8am to 5pm local time, Monday through Friday. 

The format for the office schedule consists of two parts, the day and the hours, in a semicolon delimited list. The default string is "1-5 8-17". The first part is the range for the days of the week, with 0 being Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc. The hours are numbered 0-23 and reflect a 24 hour clock. Multiple schedule elements can be aggregated with an OR operation by seperating them with semicolons. For example, "1-4 8-17; 5 8-20; 6 8-23; 0 8-20" would define an 8-5 schedule Mon-Thur, 8-8 on Friday, 8am-11pm on Saturday, and 8-8 on Sunday.
