# GLM syntax

GLM files are the primary modeling language for GridLAB-D. GLM syntax bears many similarities to C++ and other high-level languages. However it is not a procedural language even though it employs procedural blocks at times.

[Directives]
    Directives are used to define the model in the GLM file.
