ZIPload \- Residential ZIPload (explicit model) 

## Synopsis

The ZIPload model is designed to provide a means to access the residential_enduse class at a fundamental level and from a "power engineer" perspective. It uses a classic ZIP load model (constant impedance, current, and power) where "base power" is specified, then the ZIP fractions and power factors are assigned. The ZIP model equations can be defined as: 

$$P_i = \frac{|V_a^2|}{|V_n^2|}*|S_n|*Z_{\%}*cos(Z_{\theta}) + \frac{|V_a|}{|V_n|}*|S_n|*I_{\%}*cos(I_{\theta}) + |S_n|*P_{\%}*cos(P_{\theta})$$

$$Q_i = \frac{|V_a^2|}{|V_n^2|}*|S_n|*Z_{\%}*sin(Z_{\theta}) + \frac{|V_a|}{|V_n|}*|S_n|*I_{\%}*sin(I_{\theta}) + |S_n|*P_{\%}*sin(P_{\theta})$$

where: 

  *     * $P_i$: Real power consumption of the ith load
    * $Q_i$: Reactive power consumption of the ith load
    * $V_a$: Actual terminal voltage
    * $V_n$: Nominal terminal voltage
    * $S_n$: Apparent Power consumption at nominal voltage
    * $Z_\%$: Percent of load that is constant impedance
    * $I_\%$: Percent of load that is constant current
    * $P_\%$: Percent of load that is constant power
    * $Z_\theta$: Phase angle of constant impedance fraction
    * $I_\theta$: Phase angle of constant current fraction
    * $P_\theta$: Phase angle of constant power fraction
In a time-variant load representation, the coefficients of the ZIP model, $ V_n, S_n, Z_\%, I_\%, P_\%, Z_\theta, I_\theta,$ and $ P_\theta$ remain constant, but the power consumption, $P_i$ and $Q_i$, of the ith load varies with the actual terminal voltage, $V_a$. The ZIP model is similar to the polynomial representation used in many commercial software packages. In the polynomial representation of the ZIP load, the constant coefficient is roughly equivalent to the P fraction, the linear coefficient is roughly equivalent to the I fraction, and the quadratic coefficient is roughly equivalent to the Z fraction. The ZIP model only varies the power consumption as a function of actual terminal voltage, $V_a$. Note also that the sum of $Z_\%, I_\%,$ and $P_\%$ must equal one. 

Internally, the model performs all of the proper phase rotations and scaling for various voltage levels (e.g., the model would look the same for a house attached on Phase A versus Phase C). Currently, it is assumed that nominal voltage is either 120 or 240 V (this will be modified in future upgrades to residential_enduse).
