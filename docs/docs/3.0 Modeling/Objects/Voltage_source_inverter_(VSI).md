## Overview

This document describes GridLAB-D implementation of voltage source inverter (VSI). VSI is implemented in a similar way as the [diesel_dg]. A Norton current source behind an admittance is used to represent the VSI. A Thevenin voltage source is then converted from the Norton source for the calculation of voltage source _e_source_ magnitude and angle.

Two VSI modes are implemented: isochronous mode and droop mode. 

  * **The isochronous mode VSI**
    The isochronous mode VSI is usually placed at the SWING bus, with constant voltage source _e_source_ angle. In this way, frequency of the VSI is assumed to be constant. In order to keep the bus voltage at VSI at a reasonable range, the measured VSI terminal voltage is compared to the nominal voltage, and a PI voltage controller is used to obtain the magnitude of _e_source_.

[![caption](//images.shoutwiki.com/gridlab-d/thumb/1/1c/Voltage_control_of_e_source.png/400px-Voltage_control_of_e_source.png)]

The slew rate limits for both real and reactive power have been implemented in the isochronous mode VSI. An export function in the inverter object is defined to update the VSI current injection _IGenerated_ to the grid in each power flow iteration.
In each power flow iteration in solver_nr.cpp, if the VSI bus has the export function (_current_injection_update_) mapped, the export function will be executed. In this function, when the ramp rate check for real power is enabled, the real power output change from the last time step (either delta-mode time step, or steady-state mode time step) is calculated, and compared with the ramp rate limit. The ramp rate up and down limits have been defined in glm file, or given as default values. If the change exceeds the limit, the real power value is updated based on the value in the last time step, and the ramp rate limit. The updated real power output will also change the VSI current injection _IGenerated_ , as well as the _e_source_ value correspondingly.  


In addition, in the delta-mode _inter_deltaupdate_ function, real and reactive power outputs changes are compared to predefined/default real and reactive slew rate respectively, when real and reactive power slew rate check is enabled.   


To be noticed, both real and reactive power slew rate check cannot be enabled in the same time with more than one VSI in the feeder, or power flow converge problem will appear.

* **The droop mode VSI**
The droop mode VSI includes two droops: _f_ /_p_ and _v_ /_q_. Based on measured (delayed) power outputs from VSI, the corresponding frequency (and therefore _e_source_ angle) and _e_source_ magnitude are updated.

[![caption](//images.shoutwiki.com/gridlab-d/thumb/2/28/VSI_droop.png/500px-VSI_droop.png)]

The slew rate limits for both real and reactive power have been implemented in the droop mode VSI. Similar to the implementation for the isochronous mode VSI, the real power slew rate check is executed in each power flow iteration. In addition, the real and reactive power changes are examined in each delta mode time step in _inter_deltaupdate_ function.  


To be noticed, both real and reactive power slew rate check cannot be enabled in the same time with more than one VSI in the feeder, or power flow converge problem will appear.

Battery is required to be attached to VSI with enough energy stored. Simulations of VSI can still be run without the attachment of battery, but battery is added if taking into account the reality. The battery is working through the inverter object, with the state-of-charge updated in the battery object, and power outputs calculated from the inverter object. Currently if there is no Battery attached to VSI, a warning will be given, and the VSI is assumed to be attached to an infinite power input. 

## GridLAB-D implementation

### Isochronous mode VSI object example

This inverter object is a VSI in isochronous mode. The VSI is implemented under the inverter type FOUR_QUADRANT. The droop mode VSI is chosen by selecting four_quadrant_control_mode as VOLTAGE_SOURCE, VSI_mode as VSI_ISOCHRONOUS (by default VSI_mode is VSI_ISOCHRONOUS for VSI objects), use_multipoint_efficiency as FALSE, generator_status as ONLINE. The dynamic_model_mode is always given as PI for VSI objects.  
  


The isochronous mode VSI is placed on a SWINGbus. The power rating per phase given for this VSI is 1 MVA. At the first time step of the simulation, the real and reactive power outputs from the VSI are calculated based on power flow solutions, rather than based on the P_Out and Q_Out given. After entering into the delta mode, the _e_source_ angle is kept constant, and magnitude is adjusted using a PI voltage controller, with the integrator gain _ki_Vterminal_ given as 0.01, and the proportional gain _kp_Vterminal_ given as 0.1. The default filter impedance of the VSI is given as 0.0025 + j0.06 p.u..   
  
The real power slew rate is enabled in this example, with maximum ramp down rate defined as 25 MW/s, and maximum ramp up rate given as 30 MW/s.

### Droop mode VSI object example

This inverter object is a VSI in droop mode. The VSI is implemented under the inverter type FOUR_QUADRANT. The droop mode VSI is chosen by selecting four_quadrant_control_mode as VOLTAGE_SOURCE, VSI_mode as VSI_DROOP, use_multipoint_efficiency as FALSE, generator_status as ONLINE. The dynamic_model_mode is always given as PI for VSI objects.   
  
The power rating per phase given for this VSI is 1000 kVA. Before entering the delta mode, the real and reactive power outputs from the VSI are equal to the given P_Out and Q_Out values, which are 1 MW and 1MVar respectively. After entering into the delta mode, the power outputs will be based on the droop curve parameters defined. The filter impedance of the VSI is given as 0.0025 + j0.06 p.u..   
  
The reactive power slew rate is enabled in this example, with both maximum ramp down rate and maximum ramp up rate given as 20 MW/s or MVAr/s.

## Test cases

### Case 1

In IEEE 123-bus feeder, one VSI in isochronous mode is placed at swing bus, and one VSI in droop mode is placed at another bus.

Part of the feeder is disconnected at 12:00:05.0001 PST. As seem from the real power outputs result in the figure below, since the frequency is kept to 60 HZ by the isochronous VSI, the real power output of the droop VSI is kept the same. The real power outputs from isochronous VSI reduces after disconnection of the feeder.   
At 12:00:8.001 PST, the part of the feeder is reconnected. Outputs from the two VSIs return to initial values.

### Case 2

In IEEE 123-bus feeder, one VSI in droop mode is placed at swing bus, and one VSI in droop mode is placed at another bus.   

Part of the feeder is disconnected at 12:00:05.0001 PST. As seem from the real power outputs result in the figure below, real power outputs decrease at two VSIs. With the reduction of real power outputs, frequency of the VSI increases, as seen from the second figure below.
