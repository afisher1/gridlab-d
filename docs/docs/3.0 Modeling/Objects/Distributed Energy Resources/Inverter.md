## Default Inverter

The minimum definition for an inverter is 
    
    
    object inverter {
            generator_mode CONSTANT_PF;
            << implied child that provides a DC power input >>
    }
    

## Example
    
    
    module generators;
    object inverter {
         generator_mode CONSTANT_PF;
         generator_status ONLINE;
         inverter_type PWM;
         power_factor 1.0;
         parent triplex_meter2;
         << implied child that provides a DC power input >>
    }
    
    

## Volt/Var Control Mode 

The VOLT_VAR mode is used to have the inverter generate/absorb VARs based off of the system voltage seen at the inverter terminals. The output on each phase determined on the system voltage measured on said phase. for example, in a three phase inverter, the output on phase A is based off of the phase A voltage measurement, the output on phase B is based off of the phase B voltage measurement, and the output on phase C is based off of the phase C voltage measurement. The inverter determines how much VARs are generated or absorbed by a volt/VAR curve that the user creates by setting the V1, V2, V3, V4, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 parameters. See the illustration below showing curve generated by these parameters. 

![VoltVARcurve.JPG](../../images/VoltVARcurve.JPG)

The values of these parameters is per unit. V_base is used to convert the voltage measurement to a per unit value. The rated_power parameter is used to convert the per unit value of VAR output into VARs. Note that rated_power is a per-phase limit, so for three-phase inverters, the overall limit will be three-times that value. The inverter will try to output the amount of VARs determined from the curve without exceeding the power curve of the inverter.
