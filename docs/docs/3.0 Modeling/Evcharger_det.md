## Default Evcharger_det

The minimum definition for an evcharger_det object is 
    
    
    object evcharger_det {
    }
    

This will implement a deterministic EV charger equivalent to the following: 
    
    
    object evcharger_det {
           variation_mean 0.0;
           variation_std_dev 0.0;
           variation_trip_mean 0.0;
           variation_trip_std_dev 0.0;
           mileage_classification 33.0;
           work_charging_available false;
           travel_distance 15.0;
           arrival_at_work 500;	//5:00 AM arrival
           duration_at_work 11.5 h;
           arrival_at_home 1700;	//5:00 PM arrival
           duration_at_home 11.5 h;
           mileage_efficiency 3.846;
           maximum_charge_rate 1700;
           charging_efficiency 0.90;
    	}
    

## Evcharger_det Schedule

The charging schedule for the deterministic EV is primarily determined by arrival_at_home, arrival_at_work, duration_at_home, and duration_at_work. Parameters set in variation_mean and variation_std_dev will apply a normal distribution of variation to any arrival and departure times for the vehicle. The vehicle will only influence the local power grid when plugged in at home. If work charging is available, the battery state of charge will be updated, but it is assumed the vehicle is charging elsewhere on the system and not influencing the electrical properties of the current GLM. 

## Data File Example

A data file can be specified for deterministic EV chargers to aid in creating diverse populations. The data file contains information that was available from the Department of Transportation's 2001 National Household Travel Survey. With the specified data file, only the vehicle_index parameter is needed to vary the population behavior. Note that only the ARRHOME, DUR.HOME, HHVEHMILES, ARRWORK, and DUR.WORK columns are used by the evcharger_det object. These fields correspond to the arrival_at_home, duration_at_home, travel_distance, arrival_at_work, and duration_at_work fields of the EV. 

Sample NHTS-data set in CSV format:

## Example
    
    
    module residential;
    module tape;
    
    clock {
    	timezone PST+8PDT;
    	timestamp '2001-07-10 00:00:00';
    	stoptime  '2001-07-18 00:00:00'; 
    };
    
    object house {
    	object evcharger_det {
    		object recorder {
    			file charge.csv;
    			property charge_rate;
    			interval 600;
    		};
    	};
