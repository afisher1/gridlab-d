# Load Composition

This document describes the load composition methodology for estimating the load on a feeder. This methodology is important to identifying the response of the feeder to voltage changes. 

The methodology is implemented **Load composition.xls** spreadsheet locating in the [Load Composition download](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=233096&package_id=309739). If you want to load different TMY data files, you will also need to extract the TMY files from the TMY folders using the **Load TMY Data** button on the **Conditions** worksheet. 

# Aggregation method

Load composition is the term used to describe the breakdown of end-use load according to the nature of the load. The current load composition breakdown is as follows. 

  1. **Electronic $P_E$** loads are those that use power electronics. These loads typically have constant power requirements, but often have adverse harmonic characteristics that make them appear to have poor power factors.
  2. **Motor A $P_A$** are three-phase induction motors that drive constant torque loads, such as industrial and commercial compressors and refrigerators.
  3. **Motor B $P_B$** are three-phase induction motors that drive speed-squared loads with high inertia, such as fans.
  4. **Motor C $P_C$** are three-phase induction motors that drive speed-squared loads with low inertia, such as pumps.
  5. **Motor D $P_D$** are single-phase induction motors that drive constant torque load such as residential A/C compressors, refrigerators and heat-pumps.
  6. **ZIP $I_p$** is the real part of constant current loads.
  7. **ZIP $I_q$** is the reactive part of the constant current loads.
  8. **ZIP $P_p$** is the real part of constant power loads (often denoted as _P_).
  9. **ZIP $P_q$** is the reactive part of constant power loads (often denoted as _Q_).
  10. **ZIP $Z_p$** is the resistance part of constant impedance loads (often denoted as _G_)
  11. **ZIP $Z_q$** is the reactance part of constant impedance loads (often denoted as _B_)

Each load type has a contribution from residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural components. The residential includes single-family homes and multi-family buildings. Commercial loads include small and large offices, small and large retail, hotels, and motels. Industrial and agricultural loads are idiosyncratic and are not modeled in detail. 

Taken together the combined power factor of the constant loads is 

$$PF = \begin{cases} P_q + I_q + Z_q = 0 & 1 \\\ P_q + I_q + Z_q > 0 & \frac{P_p+I_p+Z_p}{\sqrt{(P_p+I_p+Z_p)^2+(P_q+I_q+Z_q)^2}} \\\ P_q + I_q + Z_q < 0 & -\frac{P_p+I_p+Z_p}{\sqrt{(P_p+I_p+Z_p)^2+(P_q+I_q+Z_q)^2}} \end{cases} 
$$

The total power (magnitude) $P_{total}$ of the composite load is 

$$P_{total} \approx |P_E| + |P_A| + |P_B| + |P_C| + |P_D| + \sqrt{(P_p+I_p+Z_p)^2+(P_q+I_q+Z_q)^2} 
$$

# Climate

TMY2 climate data [[1]](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/) is used to determine the weather conditions for any particular month, day of week, and hour of day.

In the TMY2 file, the following data is used 

  1. **Dry Bulb Temperature [1/10 °C]** , which is converted to °F;
  2. **Wind speed [tenths m/s]** , which is converted to miles/hour;
  3. **Relative humidity [%]** ;
  4. **Diffuse Horizontal Radiation [Wh/m^2]** , which is converted to Btu/sf.h; and
  5. **Direct normal Radiation [Wh/m^2]** , which is converted to Btu/sf.h.

In addition, the following data is either extracted from the TMY2 data or looked up elsewhere 

  1. **Latitude** , which is obtained using the city;
  2. **Heating design temperature [F]** , which is the minimum TMY2 observation;
  3. **Cooling design temperature [F]** , which is the maximum TMY2 observation; and
  4. **Peak solar radiation [Btu/sf.h]** , which is the maximum direct normal observation.

# Residential loads

Single and multi family dwellings are represented by typical loads, which are used to characterize a population of homes on a feeder. If multiple characteristics are needed, multiple models must be used and the results summed before computing the composite load. The load contribution to the feeder is always multiplied by the number of dwellings having those characteristics. 

## Single-family dwellings

The basic characteristics of single-family residences are shown in Table 1. 

Table 1 - Single-family residential model  Parameter | Unit | Default | Description

The end-use electricity is used to determine what fraction of the end-use load ends up as electric load, as shown in Table 2. 

Table 2 - Single-family residential end-use electrification  End-use | Default   
---|---  
Resistive heating | 20%   
Heat-pump | 40%   
Hotwater | 50%   
Cooking | 50%   
Clothesdrying | 50%   
  
The system efficiency is used to determine that operating load of the end-uses, as shown in Table 3. 

Table 3 - Single-family residential end-use efficiency  End-use | Default   
---|---  
Heating efficiency | 4.6 (COP)   
Cooling efficiency | 10.0 (SEER)   
  
The installed capacity is used to determine the total end-use load capacity per unit floor area, as shown in Table 4.

Figure 4 - ELCAP summer/weekend end-use load shapes

Before computing the diversified load, the end-use load shapes for the 5 demand-based end-uses (cooking, hotwater, lighting, plugs and washing) are used to determine the fraction of the load operating at a given time. For end-use load shapes are used for winter/summer and weekend/weekday conditions, as shown in Figures 1-4. 

The ELCAP end-use load shape are rescaled according to the daily energy use estimates, as shown in Table 5. The estimates used a approximately 50% of the original daily ELCAP consumption. 

Table 5 - Single-family residential daily end-use energy demand (kWh/day)  End-use | Winter weekday | Winter weekend | Summer weekday | Summer weekend   
---|---|---|---|---  
Cooking | 0.67 | 0.82 | 0.56 | 0.59   
Hotwater | 7.08 | 7.40 | 5.64 | 5.52   
Lighting | 7.15 | 7.45 | 5.52 | 5.47   
Plugs | 14.56 | 15.81 | 15.56 | 7.54   
Washing | 1.66 | 2.02 | 1.66 | 1.99   
  
The non-demand end-uses (heating, cooling and refrigeration) are computed directly from the power density and the end-use duty-cycle (if any) 

$$Q_x = DC_x \times PD_x \times Floorarea/1000 
$$

The final diversified end-use load is computed by looking up the rescaled ELCAP demand for the season (winter/summer) and day type (weekday/weekend), multiplying by the power density and the floor area. The final diversified load is weighted between the winter and summer values based on the day of year. 

$$Q_{winter} = Q_{ELCAP_{winter}}\frac{E_{daily_{winter}}}{E_{ELCAP_{winter}}} \times PD_x \times Floorarea/1000 
$$

  


$$Q_{summer} = Q_{ELCAP_{summer}}\frac{E_{daily_{summer}}}{E_{ELCAP_{summer}}} \times PD_x \times Floorarea/1000 
$$

  


$$\begin{align} Q_{diversified}& = Q_{winter}(1-|\sin(\frac{3.14}{12}(month-1.5))|) \\\ 
    
    
    & + Q_{summer}|\sin(\frac{3.14}{12}(month-1.5))|
    

\end{align} 
$$

Finally, the end-use load composition is determined by multiplying by the end-use composition matrix for single-family residential dwellings: 

Table 5 - Single-family residential load composition matrix  End-use | Electronic | Motor-D | Ip (Iq) | Pp (Pq) | Zp (Zq)   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Cooking | 0.25 |  |  | 0.25 |   
Hotwater |  |  |  | 0.50 |   
Lighting | 0.50 |  |  | 0.50 |   
Plugs | 0.75 |  |  |  | 0.25 (0.10)   
Washing |  | 0.35 |  | 0.15 |   
Heating |  | 0.40 |  | 0.20 |   
Cooling |  | 1.00 |  |  |   
Refrigeration |  | 0.80 |  | 0.20 |   
  
## Multi-family dwellings

Multi-family buildings are very similar to single family dwellings, except that some of the default parameters are different or calculated differently. Specifically 

Floor area
    The floor area per dwelling unit is used as the basic parameter. When combined with the **floors per building'_and_ units per floor** this give a rough approximation of the total building floor area (excluding conditioned circulation space).
Floor to floor height
    The floor height is used to compute the total building height and air volume.

The load composition matrix for multi-family buildings is shown in Table 6. 

Table 6 - Multi-family residential load composition matrix  End-use | Electronic | Motor-D | Ip (Iq) | Pp (Pq) | Zp (Zq)   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Cooking | 0.40 |  |  | 0.40 |

# Commercial loads

All commercial load composition models are developed using the [California End-Use Survey (CEUS)](http://www.energy.ca.gov/ceus/) results. These results are largely valid for the WECC, but care should be take to account to differences in construction types and building codes in regions not covered by the survey. 

Note
    The CEUS data used is for the whole state of California. There is CEUS data available for specific utilities, but that was not deemed helpful for load compositions that would apply WECC-wide.

The CEUS data from the the [Itron CEUS results website](http://capabilities.itron.com/CeusWeb/Chart.aspx) was used to obtain the commercial load tables. The _exp16day_ data set is used because it is more compact than the 8760 data set, but provides end-use load shapes for each season, day type, and hour. 

The load densities for the following end-uses are estimated for each building type. 

  * Heating
  * Cooling
  * Ventilation
  * Water heating
  * Cooking
  * Refrigeration
  * Exterior lighting
  * Interior lighting
  * Office equipment
  * Miscellaneous
  * Process equipment
  * Motors
  * Air compression
  
The basic method for determining commercial load composition is to estimate the hourly load density (W/sf) using the hourly CEUS energy data. The load densities are then multiplied by the average building **floor area** to yield the load (MW). 

The heating and cooling loads are interpolated based on the building's **balance temperature**. The heating load is multiplied by the heating duty cycle 

$$\rho_{heating} = \begin{cases} T_{out}< T_{balance}& : \frac{T_{balance}-T_{out}}{T_{balance}-T_{design_{heating}}} \\\ T_{out}\ge T_{balance}& : 0 \end{cases} $$

and similarly the cooling load is multiplied by the cooling duty cycle 

$$\rho_{cooling} = \begin{cases} T_{out}> T_{balance}& : \frac{T_{out}-T_{balance}}{T_{design_{cooling}}-T_{balance}} \\\ T_{out}\le T_{balance}& : 0 \end{cases} $$

# Industrial and agricultural loads

Industrial and agricultural loads are considered idiosynchratic and must be entered directly as an end-use load composition on their respective worksheets. 

# Analysis results

A number of analysis results are provided with the worksheets. The **Feeders** analysis enumerates the load component compositions for residential, commercial, and mixed (50/50) feeders. The Loadshapes worksheets provides daily load component shapes for Portland OR. The sensitivity analysis provides the sensitivities of component loads to temperature. 

## Feeder compositions

The feeder component compositons were computed for winter peak, typical shoulder, and summer peak conditions at 6:00, 9:00, 15:00, and 18:00 hours for a 100% single-family residential feeder, 50% single-family residential/small-office commercial mixed feeder, and a 100% small-office commercial feeder in each of the cities for which climate data was available. The tables were generated using Version 1.6.3.

## Sensitivities analysis

The load composition sensitivity analysis computes the changes in important output values with respect to changes in certain input values. The output values considered load (MW) and composition (%) for each of the building types. The input values considered are the temperature (F) and the number of buildings. 

In the spreadsheet, the sensitivity analysis is performed only when the **Update sensitivities** button on the _Composition_ worksheet is pressed. 

The following load sensitivities were calculated with Version 1.6.2 using a –1 °F perturbation on peak cooling conditions. 

Notation
    The value 0 indicates that no change was detected. The value 0.000 indicates the change was less than 0.0005. The value - indicates that the difference is between two very small or zero values.
