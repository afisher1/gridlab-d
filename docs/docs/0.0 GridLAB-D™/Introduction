# Prospective Users

What is GridLAB-D™? What can it do? Will it work for my use case? Find the answers to all these questions and more!

GridLAB-D is a power system simulation tool that provides valuable information to users who design and operate electric power transmission and distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the latest smart grid technology. It incorporates advanced modeling techniques with high-performance algorithms to deliver the latest in end-use load modeling technology integrated with three-phase unbalanced power flow, and retail market systems. Historically, the inability to effectively model and evaluate smart grid technologies has been a barrier to adoption; GridLAB-D is designed to address this problem. 

The coupling of engineered systems and markets impacts broader and broader areas of the electric power industry. Energy trading products cover shorter time periods and demand response programs are moving more and more toward real-time pricing. Market-based trading activity impacts ever more directly the physical operation of the system and the boundaries of these coupled systems extend beyond the traditional boundaries of utility-centric energy system operations. To address the gaps in our simulation capabilities, the US Department of Energy is developing GridLAB-D at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in collaboration with industry and academia. This is the first of a new generation of power distribution system simulation software. 

GridLAB-D combines end-use and power distribution automation models with other software tools, resulting in a powerful tool for power system analysis capable of running on high-performance computers. It is a flexible simulation environment that can further be integrated with a variety of third-party data management and analysis tools. 

At its core, GridLAB-D has an advanced algorithm that can determine the simultaneous state of millions of independent devices, each of which is described by multiple differential equations solved only locally for both state and time. The advantages of this algorithm over traditional finite difference-based simulators are: 
1) it is much more accurate; 
2) it can handle widely disparate time scales, ranging from sub-seconds to many years; and 
3) it is easy to integrate with new modules and third-party systems. The advantage over traditional differential-based solvers is that it is not necessary to integrate all the device's behaviors into a single set of equations that must be solved. 

At its simplest GridLAB-D can examine in detail the interplay of every part of a distribution system with every other. GridLAB-D does not require the use of reduced-order models, so the danger of erroneous assumptions is averted. GridLAB-D is more likely to find problems with programs and business strategies than any other tool available. It is therefore an essential tool for industry and government planners. 

This guide to using GridLAB-D is intended to help those who are at least slightly familiar with distribution systems to establish a foundation that will allow them to use GridLAB-D in their work. It is not intended to be comprehensive as GridLAB-D contains many models with many parameters, but rather to address some of the more important and popular features. The guide will not only address practical issues such as how certain models function but also more general topics exploring the architecture of GridLAB-D.

  * If you are unable to answer your question on the discussion forum or feel an issue is more appropriate, feel free to post a new issue on our **[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d/issues)**. We will try to respond as soon as possible.
  * An archive of the **[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/gridlab-d/discussion/)** discussion is preserved for users working with previous versions of GridLAB-D™. Note that the SourceForge forum is preserved in archival state and users can no longer interact with or create new discussions. 

# New Users

We have a number of resources for getting new users onboarded, depending on what is best for you. Visit our **[Resources](doc:resources)** page for even more content.

* **Walkthrough**: This guide to using GridLAB-D™ is intended to help those who are at least slightly familiar with distribution systems to establish a foundation that will allow them to use GridLAB-D™ in their work. It is not intended to be comprehensive as GridLAB-D™ contains many models with many parameters, but rather to address some of the more important and popular features. The guide will not only address practical issues such as how certain models function but also more general topics exploring the architecture of GridLAB-D™.
* **Online Webinars**: This is a series of webinar tutorials that were developed to describe the principles and standard usage of the major modules in GridLAB-D™. While the material is a bit out-of-date (2012), it is still mostly applicable as we try to maintain backwards compatibility. The material includes YouTube videos, along with PowerPoint presentations, demonstration models, and example cases.
* **Tutorial**: An alternative to the "walkthrough" that gives a bit more detail about certain core elements and goes into some of the design considerations, but is not as wide ranging in terms of developing models. This is a good transition from a 'new user' to a 'new developer'.

# Developers

Dive into our developer-focused content to get started:

* **Prerequisites**: Developer prerequisites for GridLAB-D™, including conventions and release processes.
* **Guide to Programming**: Designed to walk a developer through some of the key elements of GridLAB-D™ development. This does not go into the theory of the design, but rather focuses on what might facilitate the tasks of a programmer.
* **How to Write Modules**: Describes some of the necessary components for a successful object and/or module, including some of the inner workings of time synchronization, structures, and GLD property calls.

Users or developers can always ask us questions on our discussion page \[ ]. We try to monitor them on a regular basis to answer a wide range of questions.
